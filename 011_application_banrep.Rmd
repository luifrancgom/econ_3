- Check the message __Welcome greeting__ published in the News Bulletin Board.

- Dear student please edit your profile uploading a photo where your face is clearly visible.

- The purpose of the virtual meetings is to answer questions and not to make a summary of the study material.

- This presentation is based on [@carrasquilla-barrera_informe_2020, Chapter 2]

# Purpose

Examine an application of the macroeconomic concepts seen throughout the course.

# Why read the Board of Directors' Report to the Congress of Colombia?

- The Bank of the Republic of Colombia publishes different institutional reports such as:

    + The Board of Directors' Report to the Congress of Colombia
    + Monetary Policy Report (former Inflation Report)
    + Financial Stability Report
    + Foreign Reserve Management Report
    + Payment Systems Report

# Why read the Board of Directors' Report to the Congress of Colombia?

- One way to know in general the macroeconomic environment that affects companies is the **The Board of Directors' Report to the Congress of Colombia** where by law[^1] the Bank of the Republic presents to the congress the execution of monetary, exchange and credit policies, the foreign reserve management and the financial situation of the central bank.

- This report usually includes information about economic activity, the labor market, inflation, the financial sector and a balance of the external sector. The above aspects are relevant to understand the macroeconomic environment of the companies in Colombia.

[^1]: Ley 31 de 1992, Artículo 5

# Why read the Board of Directors' Report to the Congress of Colombia?

- Although there are other more detailed reports regarding certain aspects[^2], this report gives an overview of the landscape facing Colombian companies.

[^2]: For example the __Monetary Policy Report (former Inflation Report)__, __Financial Stability Report__, __Foreign Reserve Management Report__ and the __Payment Systems Report__ 

# Variables indicated in the report and seen throughout the course

# Variables indicated in the report and seen throughout the course

- "Gasto de consumo final de los hogares": $\widehat{C}_t$

- "Gasto de consumo final del gobierno general": $\widehat{G}_t$

- "Formación Bruta de Capital": $\widehat{I}_t$

- "Demand Interna": $\widehat{C}_t + \widehat{I}_t + \widehat{G}_t$

- "Exportaciones": $\widehat{X}_t$

- "Importaciones": $\widehat{IM}_t$

- "PIB"[^3]: $\widehat{Z}_t \equiv \widehat{C}_t + \widehat{I}_t + \widehat{G}_t + \widehat{X}_t - \widehat{IM}_t$

# Observations about data of the Labor Market shown in the report

- **Seasonally adjusted series** (*Serie desestacionalizada*)[^6]: result of adjusting and removing from the original series the effects of the seasonal component and the calendar effect (**Holy week and holidays**) in order to make a reasonable comparison of the data between different periods.

- **Quarterly moving average** (*Trimestre Móvil*): $$\overline{x}_{t,qma} = \frac{1}{3}\sum\limits_{n\;=\:t-2}^{t} x_n$$ 

    + Where $x_n$ is monthly data.

# Inflation measures mentioned in the report[^7]

- **Tradable inflation**

    + Include domestic market products that compete with foreign products and therefore their prices are affected by external factors.
    
- **Non-Tradable inflation**

    + Include domestic market products that do not compete abroad and their price is determined by domestic demand.
    
- **Regulated products inflation**

    + Products whose prices have a defined regulatory framework:
    
        + Fuels
        + Public services
        + Some transportation services

[^7]: Please check out [@gonzalez-molano_nueva_2020] for an update about this aspect and specially Annex 4
    
# Inflation measures mentioned in the report[^8] 

- **Food inflation**

    + Food prices are affected by supply factors. Therefore they are not easily predictable and are not directly affected by monetary policy decisions.

- **Core Inflation Indicators**

    + Is the inflation that is directly affected by monetary policy decisions. Therefore, items with volatile prices or that are outside the control of monetary policy are excluded from the Consumer Price Index (CPI) basket like:  
    
        + Food
        + Fuels, public services or transportation services that are regulated
