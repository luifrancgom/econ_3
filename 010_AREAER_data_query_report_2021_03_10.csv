2008,914,Albania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is free floating; the exchange rate of the lek is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) normally is not active in this market; intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) Severe and adverse movements in the exchange rate of the lek, which are cases of excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market: such situations are considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementation of Monetary Policy, which aims to avoid intervention in the foreign exchange market. However, lack of depth in the foreign exchange market accompanied by still strong seasonal factors (i.e., seasonal increases in the supply of foreign currency in the summer months and in December and stronger imports in the first part of the year) may result in fast one-way movements, which may disrupt activity in the domestic foreign exchange market. The bid-ask spreads may widen up to 1%, and at times banks do not deal at all with each other. Interventions in these cases aim to restore calm to a disorderly market and smooth the seasonal trend. (2) Considerable exchange rate misalignment with fundamentals: the lek is considered misaligned with fundamentals if there is a lengthy overshooting of the exchange rate. Interventions have never occurred for this reason. (3) A need to accumulate foreign reserves to meet the net international reserves (NIR) target: the NIR target is included each year in the BOAʹs monetary program and in the agreements with the IMF. The BOAʹs usual counterparts during interventions in the domestic foreign exchange markets are the commercial banks (at least four). When conditions in the domestic interbank foreign exchange market make it necessary, the BOA may carry out its interventions with foreign exchange bureaus. The BOA conducts interventions in the foreign exchange market through (1) verbal interventions, in the form of a press release in the written or electronic media and/or a press conference; and (2) transaction interventions, contacting the counterparties with the objective of buying or selling foreign currency, spot or forward, against leks. The intervention exchange rate is determined by commercial banksʹ quotes and the BOA Monetary Operations Departmentʹs quotes. When the intervention exchange rate is uniform for all counterparties, the BOA publishes it on its Reuters page and, at the same time, communicates the exchange rate to the commercial banks that do not have Reuters and to the foreign exchange bureaus with which it has contacts. When different exchange rates are used, the BOA announces only the fact that it has intervened. The BOA publishes the amount of the intervention in a quarterly bulletin that summarizes its foreign exchange operations with the banks and the public sector. The data are aggregated and published with a three-month lag. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Effective February 15, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed to floating from free floating because of the BOAʹs intervention in February 2009 in the foreign exchange market to deal with rapid change in the lek exchange rate. The BOA sets the official rate of the lek against the dollar and the euro every day, based on rates quoted by the most active and prominent domestic foreign exchange market operators. Exchange rates for currencies other than the dollar and the euro are calculated on the basis of dollar cross rates observed in international foreign exchange markets. The official rate of the lek vis-à-vis the principal foreign currencies is the rate used in settling customs obligations and in revaluing the foreign exchange positions of the BOA. Participants in the domestic foreign exchange market have no legal obligation to use the official rate in their transactions; however, the BOA requires commercial banks to use the official rate in converting the foreign currency positions reported in their monthly balance sheet data. The monetary policy target of the BOA is “to achieve and maintain price stability,” which is measured through inflation rate targets. Currently, the BOA is committed to maintaining the inflation rate at 3%, with a fluctuation band of ±1%. Inflation targeting is estimated as the annual growth of the consumer price index as measured and published by INSTAT. The intermediate target is the annual growth rate of money supply (M3 monetary aggregate). The operational targets are the net domestic assets of the BOA plus those of the banking system (net domestic credit to government) and net foreign assets of the BOA. The monetary operations of the BOA aim to meet the quantitative indicators set for these targets."
2008,612,Algeria,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange arrangement is managed floating. The external value of the dinar is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Bank of Algeria (BA) is the main buyer and seller. The BA sets the buying and selling rates of the dinar against the dollar on this market within a margin of 0.015 dinar. The BA does not disclose any information about its interventions. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The operational goal of monetary policy is a composite monetary unit."
2008,614,Angola,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. However, the BNA intervenes actively in the foreign exchange market in order to sterilize foreign currency inflows in the form of taxes paid by oil companies, which led to the stability of the kwanza exchange rate. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The BNA publishes a reference rate daily, which is computed as the transaction-weighted average of the dayʹs rates negotiated with commercial banks. The reference currency is the dollar. The reference exchange rate is calculated as follows: when the BNA is a buyer only, the buying reference rate is the weighted average of exchange rates paid by the BNA, and the selling exchange rate of the auction sessions is calculated by adding a percentage to the buying rate, to be determined by the BNA. When the BNA is the seller, the selling reference rate is the weighted average of the rates paid by the banks, and the buying rate is calculated by subtracting a percentage from the selling rate. The reference rate is applied to transactions in goods, capital, and current invisibles, pursuant to the current legislation."
2008,311,Antigua and Barbuda,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Antigua and Barbuda participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement at EC$2.70 per US$1. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, though, in practice, the coverage has been about 100%."
2008,213,Argentina,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, and the exchange rate of the Argentine peso, which is determined in the free and unified exchange market (MULC) by the interplay of supply and demand, is applied to all transactions in foreign exchange. The BCRA intervenes in the foreign exchange market each business day to execute its reserve accumulation and management policy, which acts as a stabilizer in the event of temporary changes in external financial conditions. It also does so in its capacity as the governmentʹs fiscal agency in order to meet external payment needs. The BCRA publishes its net purchases in a weekly foreign exchange report. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The peso has been more volatile since September 2008; it depreciated by 21% from September 2008 to April 2009. As a result, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement, as of October 1, 2008. Before the beginning of each year, the BCRA announces its monetary program and the projected total change in money stock. Each quarter, the BCRA publishes a report that tracks compliance with the monetary policy target."
2008,911,Armenia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Armenia maintains a de jure free floating exchange rate arrangement. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Effective July 1, 2008, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from floating. This classification was a result of the dramʹs stability within a ±1% band against the dollar since July 2008 because of increased Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) interventions to resist short-term volatility. As of March 3, 2009, the CBA decided to limit its role as a supplier in the foreign exchange market, thus returning to a de facto floating exchange rate regime. This will allow the exchange rate to find a new level that is more in line with existing macroeconomic fundamentals. The CBA will intervene in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility. Excessive volatility is defined as short-term/high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by speculative or trend-following elements, rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals, which impose significant costs on the Armenian economy. The CBA does not publish information on its interventions. Reflecting the recent exchange rate developments, in particular the absence of CBA interventions, effective March 3, 2009, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement. The official exchange rate is set as the weighted average of the buying and selling rates in the foreign exchange market and is used for accounting purposes and for treasury operations that are connected with external debt service or that create new external obligations. Foreign exchange entities use the official exchange rate for bookkeeping and revaluation purposes. The CBA pursues a policy of inflation targeting (IT) “lite,” with the objective of moving to full-fledged IT over the medium term. However, in the context of the IMF support program, the CBA effectively targets reserve money. The refinancing interest rate is the operational target."
2008,314,Aruba,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The florin is pegged to the dollar at Afl. 1.79 per $1. The Central Bank van Aruba (CBA) deals with local commercial banks within margins of 0.002795% on either side of parity.
2008,193,Australia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the RBA retains discretionary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The RBA also may vary the way the intervention is conducted; it may enter the interbank market directly through the electronic brokerage market or use an agent bank. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Given the level of development reached by the Australian foreign exchange market, interventions are rare. However, in response to disorderly conditions in the foreign exchange market, the RBA has added liquidity by selling foreign exchange and purchasing Australian dollars during the past 12 months. The frequency of the intervention remained consistent with a free float, with two periods of intervention, each less than three daysʹ duration, within the six months preceding April 2009. Monthly purchases and sales of foreign exchange are published ex-post on the CB website. The RBA publishes an indicative rate of the trade-weighted index for the Australian dollar based on market observations at 9 a.m., noon, and 4 p.m. daily. The monetary framework is inflation targeting."
2008,122,Austria,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Effective January 1, 2009, Austria participates in a currency union (EMU) with 15 (previously 14) other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The ECB publishes a reference rate based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates. The monetary policy pursued by the ECB has two formal objectives (1) an inflation rate below 2% and (2) a moderate growth of M3, with the former being dominant in practice."
2008,513,Bangladesh,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been floating since May 31, 2003. The Bangladesh Bank (BB) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Against the backdrop of significant interventions, the exchange rate arrangement has been maintained within a 2% band vis-à-vis the dollar. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The BB does not publish information on its interventions."
2008,316,Barbados,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The Barbados dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at BDS$2 per US$1."
2008,913,Belarus,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. On January 2, 2009, the exchange rate was devalued by about 21% vis-à-vis the dollar and by about 17% vis-à-vis the Russian ruble, and pegged to a basket of currency including the euro, the dollar, and the ruble. The value of the basket is calculated as the geometric mean, with equal weights for the stated currencies in the basket. The 2009 monetary policy guidelines foresee keeping the value of the basket stable by maintaining it within the limits of a ±5% band relative to its initial value. As of January 5, 2009, the actual value of the foreign currency basket has remained within the established ±5% band relative to its initial value. Thus, effective January 5, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a stabilized arrangement to a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Previously, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) officially maintained the exchange rate of the Belarusian rubel within a symmetrical horizontal band vis-à-vis the dollar (±2.5%) relative to the exchange rate of the Belarusian rubel against the dollar as of January 1, 2008. Because the exchange rate remained within a 2% band, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a stabilized arrangement. Effective June 22, the NBRB widened the fluctuation band to ±10%."
2008,124,Belgium,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Effective January 1, 2009, Belgium participates in a currency union (EMU) with 15 (previously 14) other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000.

2008,339,Belize,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Belize dollar is officially pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at the rate of BZ$1 per US$0.5. The Central Bank of Belize (CBB) quotes daily rates for the Canadian dollar, pound sterling, euro, U.S. dollar, and a number of currencies of CARICOM member countries."
2008,638,Benin,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"Benin participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rates for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro."
2008,514,Bhutan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The ngultrum is officially pegged to the Indian rupee at par. The rates for currencies other than the Indian rupee are determined on the basis of the prevailing exchange rates of the Indian rupee (average rate) against the currencies concerned. Indian rupee banknotes and coins circulate freely in Bhutan.
2008,218,Bolivia,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Bolivia has been a crawling peg vis-à-vis the dollar for more than two decades, characterized by small fluctuations for which no prior notice is given. The Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) determines the floor price on the daily, competitive foreign exchange auctions (Bolsín) in which the financial system participates. In setting the exchange rate, the CBB aims to ensure a rate consistent with moderate inflation and to mitigate external and internal inflation pressure, given the countryʹs dollarized economy, in which the exchange rate is still used as a benchmark for the price of nontradable goods. Against the backdrop of a strong external position, the CBB steadily increased the exchange rate at a moderate pace; however, in the face of external conditions and the progressive decline in inflation, the rate of appreciation of the exchange rate has stalled since October 6, 2008. The recent exchange rate stability, which is similar to the 2005 experience, when the exchange rate remained unchanged from March 16 to July 15, is the result of particular economic circumstances and does not represent a change in the crawling peg arrangement."
2008,963,Bosnia and Herzegovina,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The convertible marka is pegged to the euro at the rate of KM 1 per €0.51129. The CB covers base money, including currency in circulation and commercial bank deposits, with its foreign reserves. The Law on the Central Bank guarantees convertibility of the currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina."
2008,616,Botswana,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,The exchange rate of the pula is officially determined with reference to a weighted basket of currencies composed of the SDR and the rand. The rate of crawl of the pula is set as the difference between the Bank of Botswanaʹs (BOBʹs) inflation objective and the inflation forecast in major trading partner countries. The spread between the buying and selling rates of the pula is 0.125%.
2008,223,Brazil,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the real is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange interbank market in which the Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) occasionally participates. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies Effective May 27, 2009, the CBB publishes the daily amount of its interventions on its website. The information is updated once a week. Previously, the CBB did not usually publish data on daily intervention, although some information was made available in the CBBʹs monthly report and speeches by officials. Brazil has implemented a formal inflation-targeting framework for monetary policy. The operational target is the overnight interest rate (Selic)."
2008,516,Brunei Darussalam,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The Brunei dollar is issued by the Brunei Currency and Monetary Board (BCMB). Under the terms of the Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA), signed in 1967, which remains in effect between the BCMB and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the monetary authorities agreed to the mutual exchange of each otherʹs currency at par without charge. The authorities and banks in Brunei Darussalam and Singapore must accept each otherʹs currency at par, and the currencies are customary tender in both countries. Excess Brunei or Singapore currency is repatriated regularly, and the cost of repatriation is borne by the currency-issuing authority. The BCMB has to ensure that reserves cover at least 70% of base money."
2008,918,Bulgaria,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"According to an amendment to the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB), the de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board arrangement. The reference currency is the euro, at the rate of lev 1.95583 per €1."
2008,748,Burkina Faso,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"Burkina Faso participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro."
2008,618,Burundi,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Bank of the Republic of Burundi (BRB) sets the official exchange rate daily on the basis of a weighted average of commercial bank rates. The official exchange rate is used for government transactions and to adjust banksʹ net open positions. The BRB does not disclose intervention data. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The monetary policy aims to control the monetary aggregates, with the reserve money as operational target."
2008,522,Cambodia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Given the high degree of financial dollarization, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) occasionally intervenes in the foreign exchange market to accommodate demand for riels. Data on intervention are available on request. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The official exchange rate is computed based on the average daily market rate of the previous day, which is adjusted by taking into account the liquidity conditions in the market. The official rate applies to all official external transactions and is used for accounting purposes by the NBC."
2008,622,Cameroon,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"Cameroon participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also listed officially based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates for the foreign currencies prevailing on the Paris foreign exchange market. The monetary cooperation agreement established between CAEMC member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Buying and selling rates for foreign currencies other than the euro are set on the basis of the fixed exchange rate of the CFA franc and the euro and the rate of the foreign currency in question against the euro on the foreign exchange market."
2008,156,Canada,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, with the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar determined on the basis of supply and demand. However, the Bank of Canada (BOC) may intervene in the foreign exchange market on behalf of the federal government to counter disruptive short-term movements in the exchange rate, if necessary. Canadaʹs current policy is to intervene in foreign exchange markets on a discretionary, rather than a systematic, basis and only in the most exceptional circumstances. Intervention policy is established by the government in close consultation with the BOC. The BOC has not intervened since September 1998. When an intervention occurs, an announcement is made on the BOCʹs website. The amount of the intervention is available in the governmentʹs monthly official press release on international reserves. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Inflation targeting has been a cornerstone of Canadian monetary policy since its introduction in 1991. At present, the target range is 1% to 3%, with the BOCʹs monetary policy aimed at keeping inflation at the 2% target midpoint."
2008,624,Cape Verde,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Cape Verde escudo is pegged to the euro at the rate of CVEsc 110.27 per €1. There is no official bid-ask spread in euros. Banks are required to sell and buy euros from their clients at the official rate plus a fixed transaction fee of CVEsc 500.
2008,626,Central African Republic,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The Central African Republic participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially listed on the basis of the fixed rate for the euro and the rates for those foreign currencies prevailing on the Paris foreign exchange market. The monetary cooperation agreement established between CAEMC member countries and the French Republic is based mainly on three pillars: (1) a common institute of issue, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee."
2008,628,Chad,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"Chad participates in a currency union with five other members of the CAEMC and has no separate legal tender.

2008,228,Chile,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate of the peso is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Chile (CBC) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market to keep the currency near its equilibrium value in order to avoid costly reversals in the future. These interventions take the form of transparent, well-founded measures, which include explicit definitions of the periods and amounts involved and clearly explained reasons for these exceptional interventions. The CBC announces the amount of foreign exchange it intends to buy or sell in its monthly bulletin. On April 10, 2008, the CBC announced a US$8 billion intervention program to take place between April and December 2008 owing to anticipated international financial market turmoil. The program was suspended September 29, 2008, owing to the worsening of world financial markets. The CBC introduced a foreign exchange auction on March, 27, 2009, to sell foreign exchange on the Treasuryʹs account. The CBC publishes its reserves on a weekly basis. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from an independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The CBC pursues an inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy. Since 2007, the explicit objective of the CBC is to maintain annual inflation of the consumer price index at about 3% most of the time, with a tolerance range of ±1%. This objective should be permanently achieved within a medium-term horizon of two years."
2008,233,Colombia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. All foreign exchange transactions are conducted at a market-determined exchange rate; however, the Banco de la República (BR) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to adjust the level of international reserves, limit excess volatility of the exchange rate, and influence the speed of adjustment of the nominal exchange rate. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The BR can intervene at its discretion or via an automatic mechanism designed to limit volatility. The monthly results of the BRʹs intervention on the foreign exchange market and information on each auction are available on the governmentʹs website. The tasa representativa del mercado (market representative rate, TRM) is the official economic indicator of the peso vis-à-vis the dollar. The indicator is calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the weighted rates of foreign exchange purchases and sales carried out by financial institutions in the main cities of the country for settlement in both currencies on the same day. The market indicator is currently calculated and certified daily by the Financial Superintendency (SF) of Colombia, based on the financial transactions reported for the previous business day. The indicator is used as the reference for the quotation and settlement of foreign exchange transactions, for operations indexed to the dollar, and for the conversion of accounts in foreign currency into local currency. The BR uses the indicator for the settlement of foreign exchange options. The monetary policy framework is inflation targeting. The inflation target range for 2008 was between 3.5% and 4.5% and for 2009 is between 4.5% and 5.5%. The long-term inflation target range is between 2.0% and 4.0%."
2008,632,Comoros,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The Comoros participates in the franc zone area. The Comorian franc is officially pegged to the euro at CF 491.96775 per €1.

2008,238,Costa Rica,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Since October 17, 2006, the de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a crawling band arrangement with an increasing but moderate width. The band is defined in terms of colones per $1 and does not include a central parity. The edges of the band are periodically adjusted whenever warranted by financial and macroeconomic conditions. The system had an initial width of 3%. Effective July, 16, 2008, the intervention buying rate (floor of the band) was increased from C 488.73 to C 500.00 per $1, and the intervention selling rate (ceiling of the band) was lowered from C 572.49 to C 555.37 per $1. The floor was fixed and the ceiling of the band increased every business day by C 0.06 (2.7% on an annualized basis). This meant a discrete increase of 2.3% in the lower limit and a reduction of 3.0% in the upper limit of the exchange band. At the time of the latest adjustment, on January 22, 2009, which set the floor of the band at C 500 (previously, 498.39) per $1 and the ceiling at C 563.25 (previously, 562.83) per $1, the width reached 12.6%. The floor of the band is fixed, whereas effective January 22, 2009, the rate of crawl of the bandʹs ceiling is C 0.20 (previously, C 0.06) per business day, resulting in an annual depreciation of about 9%. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a crawling band to other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology, which removed the category crawling band from the classification categories. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies."
2008,662,Côte dʹIvoire,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"Côte dʹIvoire participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market vis-à-vis the euro."
2008,960,Croatia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) may set intervention exchange rates, which it applies in transactions with banks outside the interbank market to limit exchange rate volatility. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The exchange rate of the kuna vis-à-vis the euro remained broadly stable in 2008 because of overall market conditions and the actions of the CNB to stabilize it on several occasions, but it depreciated by approximately 3% in December 2008 and again in January 2009. As a result, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective January 1, 2009. Intervention data (prices and volumes) are published on the CNB website. The monetary policy aims at stability of the kuna vis-à-vis the euro."
2008,423,Cyprus,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Effective January 1, 2008, Cyprus participates in a monetary union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2009, 15 other members (previously, 14) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. As a result, effective January 1, 2008, the exchange rate regime of Cyprus has been reclassified to the category independently floating from the category pegged exchange rate within a horizontal band. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The ECB publishes a reference rate based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates. The monetary policy pursued by the ECB has two formal objectives: (1) an inflation rate below 2% and (2) a moderate growth of M3, with the former being dominant in practice."
2008,935,Czech Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The external value of the koruna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) participates. The CNB pursues a program of sales of foreign exchange reserves, broadly equivalent to the amount of portfolio gains on its reserves, aimed at preventing the level of reserves from continuing to rise. Other interventions have been limited to conversion of large one-off privatization receipts and proceeds of EU transfers. The CNB publishes its monthly foreign exchange transaction data on its website, with some lag. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The CNB publishes daily rates of 35 selected currencies against the koruna for customs and accounting purposes. The CNBʹs primary objective is to maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the CNB also supports the general economic policies of the government. The CNB achieves its primary objective by making changes to key interest rates. The inflation target is 3% (±1%) until the end of 2009 and 2% (±1%) from 2010 onward."
2008,636,Democratic Republic of the Congo,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate of the Congo franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The BCC, while observing the international reserves target in its monetary program, intervenes to smooth exchange rate fluctuations, but not against market fundamentals. The BCC intervened once in January 2009. Previously, it had refrained from intervening since November 2007. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies.

2008,128,Denmark,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The formal framework for the Danish fixed-exchange-rate policy is the ERM II. Denmark participates in the ERM II with a central rate of DKr 746.038 per €100. The central rate is a conversion of the central rate vis-à-vis the deutsche mark before the third stage of EMU and was last adjusted in January 1987. Denmark has entered into an agreement with the ECB and the euro area member states on a narrower fluctuation band of ±2.25%. In recent years, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) has consistently maintained, as a matter of policy, a stable krone within less than 1% of the central rate. The DNʹs net purchase or sale of foreign currency during a month is published at 4:00 p.m. on the second working day of the following month in the “Foreign Exchange and Liquidity” press release."

The CBDR publishes its foreign exchange sale and purchase transactions daily on its website. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The reference rate used by the CBDR for its operations is set as the weighted average of daily rates reported by authorized exchange intermediaries. The reference rate is used for statistical purposes. The monetary policy is guided by multiple indicators."

2008,469,Egypt,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate is determined mainly through supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) buys and sells foreign exchange daily at the rate prevailing in the interbank market as deemed necessary by the government. However, the authorities maintain close control over the pound. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The spot exchange rate is based on compilation of data sent by banks and nonbank dealers via a special network. The CBE determines the rate as the weighted average dollar/pound rate calculated automatically on the basis of all transactions completed during the day in the interbank market. Decree No. 40 of 2006 provides for intraday adjustment of the CBEʹs exchange rate for official transactions. The CBE does not publish its intervention data.

The exchange rate of the birr vis-à-vis the dollar was very stable through late 2007, but has consistently depreciated since then. Hence, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed, effective February 2, 2008, from a conventional pegged arrangement to a crawling peg. In January 2009, the birr was devalued twice before reverting to the original trend. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a crawling peg to a crawl-like arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology.

Effective August 7, 2008, when the conflict with Russia started, the authorities announced that the lari-dollar exchange rate would be kept stable. As a result, the exchange rate depreciated by 1.2% until November 4, 2008, when the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) allowed the depreciation to accelerate, which resulted in a devaluation of 16% on November 10, 2008, when the authorities formally adopted a floating exchange rate regime. After several weeks of pegging the exchange rate at lari 1.65 per $1, the lari started to fluctuate moderately again around that level. Because of the exchange rate stability, effective September 1, 2008, the exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from floating. Effective March 6, 2009, the authorities introduced a foreign exchange auction and phased out their direct intervention to influence the price of the lari on the market. Therefore, effective that day, the exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement. The official exchange rate for the dollar is determined daily and is used for budget and tax accounting purposes and for all payments between the government and businesses and other legal entities. The official rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of the cross rates for the dollar and other currencies in the international market.

Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Intervention data are publicly available on the BOG website. Because there is no commitment to a certain level or trajectory of the nominal exchange rate, the BOG has monetary autonomy to ensure the fundamental objective of achieving low and stable inflation.

These rates are determined by supply and demand in the foreign currency market. The CB calculates the average dollar-franc rate charged by banks, weighted by the volume of transactions. The rates of other currencies are calculated on the basis of their previous dayʹs rate vis-à-vis the SDR, as published by the IMF. However, to avoid excessive daily fluctuations because of a thin market, daily fluctuations of the reference rate are capped at ±0.5%. The reference rate is used only for accounting purposes. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies.

2008,336,Guyana,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the Guyana dollar is determined in the cambio market. The Bank of Guyana (BOG) periodically purchases foreign currency from cambio dealers in order to maintain international reserves at acceptable levels. The BOG conducts its transactions on the basis of the cambio exchange rate by periodically averaging quotes from the three largest dealers. In accordance with bilateral agreements with the CARICOM CBs, the BOG quotes weekly rates for certain CARICOM currencies. Reflecting the stability of the Guyana dollar against the U.S. dollar as a result of interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement classification is a stabilized arrangement. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies."
2008,263,Haiti,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Foreign exchange sales and purchases by the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) are used for liquidity management and for smoothing exchange rate fluctuations. The BRH publishes information on foreign exchange intervention on its website. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Although base money is an indicative target for monetary policy, the CB looks at exchange rate movements (given the high pass-through of inflation), liquidity conditions, and growth."
2008,268,Honduras,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling band. The exchange rate of the lempira is determined by foreign exchange auctions of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). Because the authorities maintained a policy of meeting all admissible bids within the ±7% band around the base price, the exchange rate was effectively pegged at the most appreciated edge of the band. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Effective May 8, 2008, the BCH has introduced an operational band requiring all bid prices for the purchase of foreign exchange to be within a range of 7% above or below the base price established, with such prices subject to the requirement that bids for subsequent auctions must not exceed 0.075% of the average reference rate derived from auctions concluded within the seven preceding business days. Because the exchange rate has remained effectively pegged to the dollar, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2008,944,Hungary,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from free floating as of March 1, 2009, because of discretionary intervention on the foreign exchange market by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB). Previously, the central parity and the exchange rate band of the Hungarian forint were abolished February 26, 2008; hence, effective this date, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to independently floating from a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Under the band system, the Hungarian forint traded against the euro within a band of ±15% (introduced October 1, 2001) around a central rate of Ft 282.36 per €1. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from independently floating to free floating retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The possible objectives of foreign exchange intervention are listed in the MNBʹs intervention strategy, which has not been published. The strategy aims at avoiding disruptive market fluctuation and exchange rate overshooting. However, it emphasizes that the MNB generally refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange market. The MNB converts foreign currency for the government and EU transfers off-market. The net open position resulting from these transactions changes the foreign exchange reserve position of the MNB. If the resulting reserve dynamics are not in line with the MNBʹs reserve management objectives, some of the position is channeled to the market. Typically, this has resulted in foreign currency sales in the past few years. Sales are conducted in small amounts at market prices. The MNB announces the policy of channeling the foreign exchange position resulting from the government-related foreign exchange flows to the market. The net amounts are published quarterly. The MNB has adopted a medium-term target for inflation for the period starting in 2007, expressed as a 3% rate of increase in consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index regularly published by the Central Statistical Office."
2008,176,Iceland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. As a result of the financial crisis, which started during fall 2008, the foreign exchange market underwent major disruption, forcing the monetary authorities to temporarily take over the foreign exchange pricing mechanism. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Effective October 15, 2008, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from free floating as a result of increased intervention on the foreign exchange market in the context of the financial crisis. The Central Bank of Icelandʹs (CBIʹs) foreign exchange transactions are published daily on its website on the same day. A formal inflation target was adopted on March 27, 2001. The CBIʹs main objective is price stability, defined as a 12-month rise of 2½% in the consumer price index. If it deviates by more than 1½% in either direction, the CBI is obliged to present to the government a report, which is made public, explaining the reasons for the deviation from the target and the CBIʹs response to the deviation. However, the financial crisis of late 2008 has rendered the inflation-targeting framework inoperative."
2008,534,India,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) periodically intervenes. In its interventions, the RBI purchases and sells spot and forward dollars in the interbank market at the market exchange rate. The RBI deals only with ADs. The RBI publishes monthly data on intervention (foreign exchange purchases and sales) in both the spot and the forward market in the RBI Monthly Bulletin. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The monetary policy is guided by multiple indicators."
2008,536,Indonesia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Indonesia adopted a freely floating exchange rate arrangement on August 14, 1997. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the Bank Indonesia (BI) may intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. The BI does not disclose data on its intervention. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Reflecting developments in the exchange rate following official interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The BI formally adopted an inflation-targeting framework. The government has set the inflation targets for 2008, 2009, and 2010 at 5%, 4.5%, and 4%, ±1%, respectively, after coordinating with the BI."
2008,433,Iraq,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has allowed the exchange rate to appreciate gradually vis-à-vis the dollar following a predetermined path. Within these limits, the exchange rate of the dinar is determined in the foreign exchange market."
2008,178,Ireland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Effective January 1, 2009, Ireland participates in a currency union (EMU) with 15 (previously, 14) other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The ECB publishes a reference rate based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates. The monetary policy pursued by the ECB has two formal objectives: (1) an inflation rate below 2% and (2) a moderate growth of M3, with the former being dominant in practice."
2008,512,Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The afghani depreciated against the dollar by 5% in 2008 and was volatile thereafter. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. In the absence of alternative monetary policy instruments, the DAB intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market in the form of twice-weekly foreign exchange auctions. The primary goal of these auctions is to control the growth of currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction volatility of the exchange rate. The DAB also has a currency-in-circulation target in the context of an IMF program. Indicative interbank buying and selling rates for nine currencies against the afghani are collected from 10 dealers in the foreign exchange market on a daily basis between 9:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. The DABʹs official reference rates are then determined as the average of market rates for each currency. The official exchange rate is provided as a daily benchmark or reference point to commercial banks, private sector entities, and government agencies to use in their own transactions."
2008,429,Islamic Republic of Iran,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed floating arrangement against a basket of currencies. Although the authorities remain in control of the exchange rate, the rialʹs volatility against the dollar, the euro, and the yen has increased. Therefore, effective March 1, 2008, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate from a crawling peg arrangement. Previously, the rial gradually depreciated against a composite of currencies, including the euro, the dollar, and the yen. Thus, effective January 4, 2008, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a crawling peg. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies."
2008,436,Israel,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate policy is based on a free float of the sheqel vis-à-vis other currencies, and for many years the Bank of Israel (BOI) has pursued a policy of nonintervention in the foreign exchange market. However, the BOI retains the option to intervene through the purchase or sale of foreign currency in the interbank market, should the need arise. In March 2008, the BOI implemented a program to boost its foreign reserves to $35–$40 billion via daily purchases and to deal with disorderly market conditions. The intervention program was announced five days in advance on the BOI website. On July 10, 2008, in response to market conditions, the BOI announced an increase in its daily purchases to $100 million. The BOI deals at the best price quoted by market makers. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The government has set an inflation target as part of its economic policy, and the objective of monetary policy is to reach that target. It does so by determining the level of short-term interest rates on its loans to the banks and deposits from them, and thus, via the financial markets, influences the money supply in the economy."

The exchange rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market, where the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) intervenes frequently. The BOJ publishes information on its foreign exchange market interventions in its Annual Report and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology.

2008,158,Japan,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the yen is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disorderly conditions in the market. The principal intervention currency is the dollar. Foreign exchange interventions are implemented by the MOF, which publishes the daily amount of purchases and sales on its website. There has been no intervention since March 2004. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology.

The dinar is officially pegged to the SDR, but in practice, it has been pegged to the dollar since late 1995. The difference between the CBJʹs buying and selling rates is 0.3%."
2008,916,Kazakhstan,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within a horizontal band. The main intervention currency is the dollar. The NBK does not publish data on its interventions. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other (economic) policies. On February 4, 2009, the tenge was devalued by 18% and, in accordance with the NBKʹs announcement, a trading band has been established vis-à-vis the dollar at ±3%. Therefore, effective February 4, 2009, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands from a stabilized arrangement. The official exchange rate of the tenge against the dollar is determined on the basis of daily quotes from the domestic currency market (the weighted average rate at 11:00 a.m. the previous day, based on trading results on the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange—KASE). The rates for other currencies are calculated on the basis of quotes against the dollar on the global currency market. The NBK publishes daily exchange rates of certain currencies against the tenge for accounting and customs payment computation purposes."
2008,664,Kenya,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. Official foreign exchange market interventions aim to moderate the rate of change and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than establish a particular level.

2008,443,Kuwait,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Effective May 20, 2007, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is conventional peg, where the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK) fixes the value of the Kuwaiti dinar against an undisclosed basket of currencies. The regime for the calculation of the Kuwaiti dinarʹs declared exchange value is similar to that applied in the period prior to January 5, 2003, when the exchange value of the dinar was changed to a peg versus the dollar with allowed margins of variation. Because the observed exchange rate movements do not confirm any constant weights of the currency composite, the de facto classification has been changed to other managed arrangement from a conventional peg as of January 1, 2009. The CBK does not publish its intervention data."

The Banque du Liban (BDL) monitors the official exchange rate as part of its role to maintain sustainable economic growth, a stable inflation rate, a stable purchasing power, and accordingly social and economic stability. In practice, the exchange rate remains within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the dollar. The BDL intervenes in the foreign exchange market daily from 10:00 a.m. till 2:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and from 10:00 a.m. till noon on Friday.

2008,668,Liberia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Liberia participates in the W-ERM II, which requires that the Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) maintain the spot exchange rate between the Liberian dollar and the U.S. dollar within a margin of ±15% around a central rate. However, the CBL has yet to implement these measures. The CBL intervenes in the foreign exchange market to counter speculative movements. The exchange rate has remained stable since January 8, 2008. As a result, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified effective that date, to a conventional pegged arrangement from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology.

The CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro."
2008,181,Malta,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Effective January 1, 2008, Malta participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2009, 15 other members (previously, 14) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The final conversion rate for the Maltese lira was Lm 0.4293 per €1. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. Effective January 1, 2008, the de facto exchange rate regime of Malta was reclassified to independently floating from a conventional pegged arrangement as a result of joining the euro area. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The ECB publishes a reference rate based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates. The monetary policy pursued by the ECB formally has two objectives: (1) an inflation rate below 2% and (2) a moderate growth of M3, with the former being dominant in practice."
2008,867,Marshall Islands,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange.
2008,682,Mauritania,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The ouguiya was previously de facto pegged to the dollar, at an exchange rate of UM 268.6 per $1. The new foreign exchange market operates in the framework of a fixing, in which the CB intervenes. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology.

The monetary framework pursues multiple targets."
2008,684,Mauritius,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Intervention by the Central Bank of Mauritius (CBM) is limited to smoothing operations and does not aim to offset market forces. Information on interventions is published regularly on the CBMʹs website and in its publications. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to of the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The CBM did not intervene in the foreign exchange market from December 2008 through April 2009. As a result, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to free floating from floating as of November 1, 2008. The CBM pursues multiple indicators of monetary policy."
2008,273,Mexico,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the peso is determined in the foreign exchange market. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. A new intervention policy was implemented in October 2008 aimed at reducing the exchange rateʹs daily volatility, which had increased because of the global financial crisis. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from free floating as of October 9, 2008. The authorities expressed their intention to phase out this type of intervention during the second half of 2009. Previously, the Banco de Mexico (BOM) sold a preannounced fixed amount of dollars at auctions to channel some of its accumulated reserves from previous periods back to the market. BOM interventions have not aimed to target any specific level of the exchange rate or to put a ceiling or floor on the movements of the exchange rate. The BOM publishes all intervention data on its website on the same day, including unscheduled auctions. During the six months preceding April 30, 2009, the BOM used two rules-based and preannounced mechanisms in order to address disorderly market conditions. The BOM also carried out discretionary interventions. In early February 2009, the BOM intervened in the market through direct sales to individual participants in the market for an aggregate amount of US$1.8 billion. The dates of these interventions were February 4, 5, 6, 20, 23, and 27, 2009. The announcement of such interventions was done at the close of the business day, and only weekly amounts were made public. The exchange rate (FIX) is determined by the BOM as an average of quotes in the wholesale foreign exchange market for operations payable in 48 hours. The BOM determines the FIX at noon on each banking day, after receiving all the quotes and making the respective calculation. It is published in the Official Gazette (Diario Oficial de la Federación) one banking business day after its determination date and is used to settle liabilities denominated in dollars payable in Mexico on the next day. The FIX rate serves only as a reference; its use in foreign exchange transactions by market participants is not mandatory. In pursuing monetary policy, the BOM tries to influence interest rates and inflation expectations in order to make price behavior consistent with the objective of ensuring an environment of low and stable inflation. Article 2 of the BOM law specifies that the BOMʹs primary objective is to seek the stability of the purchasing power of the domestic currency. The BOM also aims to promote the sound development of the financial system and foster the proper functioning of payment systems."
2008,921,Moldova,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Moldova (NBM) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the Moldovan leu against the dollar. Sharp exchange rate fluctuations are not specifically defined; however, the NBM intervenes on the domestic foreign exchange market depending on the market conditions and future expectations of the market participants. At the same time, the NBM interventions are not aimed at changing the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The NBM publishes the information on its interventions. The official exchange rate of the leu against the dollar is determined daily as the weighted average of the exchange rates used in market noncash transactions, performed on the interbank and intrabank market. The official exchange rate is used in accounting and statistical calculations. Institutions eligible to deal in foreign exchange are licensed banks and foreign exchange offices. The monetary policy aims to control monetary aggregates."
2008,948,Mongolia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market using the dollar as the principal intervention currency. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Against the backdrop of a rapid devaluation of the togrog between October 2008 and February 2009, the exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement as of November 1, 2008. On March 24, 2009, the BOM instituted a foreign exchange auction allowing the determination of the exchange rate mainly by market forces. Therefore, effective March 24, 2009, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from other managed arrangement. The BOMʹs official exchange rate is the midpoint of exchange rates in the interbank market and is announced each weekday except for national public holidays. This reference rate is valid until the next announcement of the new exchange rate by the BOM. Previously, the official (reference) exchange rate of the togrog vis-à-vis the dollar was announced daily by the BOM as the daily average of the buying and selling rates of transactions among participants in the interbank foreign exchange market. The official exchange rate is applied to customs valuation and public sector imports and service payments, including debt service, and to trade and service transactions conducted under bilateral payments arrangements. Exchange rates for other convertible currencies are calculated on the basis of the cross rates vis-à-vis the dollar in international markets. The BOM pursues M2 as an intermediate target and reserve money as an operational target in the context of an IMF-supported program."
2008,686,Morocco,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The dirham has been pegged since 1973 to a basket of currencies weighted in accordance with the geographic distribution of Moroccoʹs foreign trade. The composition of this basket is subject to adjustment. Since April 2001, the basket has been composed of the euro and the dollar, with weights of 80% and 20%, respectively. Several price adjustments may be made during the day, based on the trend of foreign currencies on the international market. There is a fixing that takes place at 2:00 p.m., which also includes the currencies of the Arab Maghreb Union countries."

Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The Bank of Mozambique (BM) announces the average foreign exchange buying and selling rates of commercial banks in the interbank foreign exchange market (MCI), which the banks record using software provided by the BM. The exchange rate is calculated as the average of the exchange rates quoted by the commercial banks as determined at 3:30 p.m. the previous day. This rate is used by the BM in its foreign exchange buying and selling transactions in the MCI (including auction sales), based on the best-price criterion (highest sale price and lowest purchase price). The monetary policy of the BM aims at controlling monetary aggregates."

The exchange rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of the daily foreign exchange rates in the Singapore market. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology.

2008,196,New Zealand,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may intervene if the exchange rate is exceptionally high or low, if that rate is not justified by economic fundamentals, and if there is a material prospect that the intervention will influence the exchange rate. Interventions may not be used as an attempt to influence the long-term trend of the exchange rate. As a result, RBNZ interventions are very rare. The RBNZ publishes information on its international reserves and foreign exchange swap position on its website, but does not publish data on its direct intervention. The RBNZ has not intervened with the purpose of influencing the New Zealand dollar since October 2008. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The Reserve Bank Act requires that price stability be defined in a specific and public contract, the Policy Targets Agreement (PTA), negotiated between the government and the RBNZ. The current PTA, signed in December 2008, defines price stability as annual increases in the consumer price index (CPI) of between 1% and 3% on average over the medium term. This implies that monetary policy targets CPI inflation and not the exchange rate."

2008,694,Nigeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. After a period of stability from April 2008 to November 2008, the CBN allowed the exchange rate to depreciate in December 2008, but reiterated its commitment to a stable exchange rate and announced a ±3% band for the naira on February 9, 2009, around the official rate recorded on that date (N 145.85 to $1). Since then, the naira has remained close to the central rate. The exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to a conventional pegged arrangement from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate, effective April 1, 2008, because of the stability of the naira against the dollar. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The de facto exchange rate arrangement has been further reclassified from a stabilized arrangement to other managed arrangement, effective January 1, 2009, because of the increased volatility of the naira at the end of 2008 and the frequent changes in policy. Since January 19, 2009, the auction has been the only mechanism through which the CBN provides foreign exchange to the market; previously it also intervened in the interbank market. The CBN publishes information on its interventions through auction; however, data on interventions in the interbank market are not disseminated. Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the naira and the dollar be maintained within ±15% around the central rate. The CBN has not implemented this regime. The monetary policy aims to control monetary aggregates."
2008,142,Norway,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the krone floats freely and independently against other currencies. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Norges Bank (NB) does not normally intervene to influence the exchange rate of the krone; however, it may intervene in the foreign exchange market on short notice if the krone deviates substantially from the level that the NB considers reasonable in relation to fundamentals, and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target. The NB may also intervene in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level. The NB has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Foreign exchange purchases for the government pension fund are publicly preannounced and recorded on the CB website. The monetary policy framework is inflation targeting.

2008,288,Paraguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; the exchange rate of the guaraní is determined by supply and demand. The Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) intervenes in the exchange market to smooth the effects of undue fluctuations in the exchange rate and achieve the targets set for international reserves in an IMF-supported program. The objective of the CBP under Article 3 of its Organic Law (489/95) is to preserve and safeguard the stability of the value of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Moreover, Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the CBP aims to smooth seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. The CBP publishes information on its foreign exchange interventions. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The official exchange rate is computed by the CBP by taking the average of rates used in major foreign exchange transactions in the market. The rate is usually announced at 1:00 p.m. every day.

2008,924,Peopleʹs Republic of China,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"China officially maintains a floating exchange rate system based on market supply and demand, regulated with reference to a basket of currencies. Although market supply and demand play a role in determining the renminbi (RMB) exchange rate, the observed path of the exchange rate and information on intervention and reserves buildup suggest that the exchange rate is determined mainly by official action. Recently, the RMB has shown the characteristics of a stabilized arrangement. Therefore, effective June 1, 2008, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed to a stabilized arrangement from a crawl-like arrangement. Previously, the RMB was classified as a crawling peg, because the RMB–U.S. dollar exchange rate has remained within a 2% crawling band. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a crawling peg to a crawl-like arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The daily U.S. dollar–RMB trading price on the interbank spot foreign exchange market floats within a 0.5% range around the middle trading price for U.S. dollars announced by the China Foreign Exchange Trading Center (CFETC). Trading prices for the RMB against the euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling float within a 0.3% range around the middle trading prices for non–U.S. dollar currency transactions announced by the CFETC. The CFETC is authorized to announce the daily mid-exchange rates for the RMB against the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling at 9:15 a.m. each working day, to serve as midrates of the day for the interbank spot foreign exchange market (including the over-the-counter method and the matching method) as well as the mid-exchange rates in bank counter transactions. The method for determining the RMB–U.S. dollar middle rate is as follows: the CFETC, before the daily interbank foreign exchange market opening quote, asks for quotes from all market makers in the interbank foreign exchange market and uses the market makersʹ quoted prices as a calculation sample for the RMB–U.S. dollar exchange rate midrate. After eliminating the highest and lowest quotes, it takes the weighted average of the remaining market makersʹ quotes and obtains the daily RMB–U.S. dollar foreign exchange midrate. The weighting is determined by the CFETC based on indicators including the transaction volume of the quoting parties in the interbank foreign exchange market and the circumstances of the quotes. The midrates for the RMB against the euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling are determined by the CFETC based on the current dayʹs midrate for the RMB against the U.S. dollars and the exchange rates for the euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling against the U.S. dollar on international foreign exchange markets at 9:00 a.m."
2008,532,Peopleʹs Republic of China—Hong Kong SAR,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires the monetary base to be backed by the reserve currency (U.S. dollar) around an exchange rate of HK$7.80 per US$1. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75–HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—has been used since May 18, 2005. The monetary base includes the notes and coins issued, the balance held with the HKMA of banksʹ clearing accounts (i.e., the aggregate balance), and the outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Consistent with currency board principles, the HKMA may issue additional Exchange Fund paper when there is an inflow of funds, and the size of the program is allowed to expand along with the interest payments on such paper. Issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which provide backing for banknotes issued by banks, must be made against U.S. dollars at the fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per US$1. Issuance and withdrawal of coins and government-issued notes are settled against U.S. dollars at the same fixed rate."
2008,293,Peru,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the nuevo sol is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the Central Reserve Bank of Peru (CRBP) is authorized by law to intervene in the foreign exchange market. At times, the exchange rate has shown modest flexibility in the context of CRBP interventions; recently, it has shown more flexibility. Intervention may also be conducted using bonds indexed to the exchange rate and repos. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The CRBP publishes information on its interventions (prices and amounts) on its website. The official exchange rate corresponds to the average interbank exchange rate used in the operations performed through the market real-time system DATATEC. Exchange rates of currencies other than the dollar are determined on the basis of their cross rates with the dollar. The monetary framework is inflation targeting. The CRBP has a continuous inflation target of 2% with a tolerance band between 1% and 3%."
2008,566,Philippines,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) adheres to a market-determined exchange rate policy with some scope for occasional action solely to prevent sharp fluctuations that could be disruptive. This means that the BSP does not target or support a given level of exchange rate; instead, it allows the value of the peso to be determined by the supply and demand of foreign exchange. The BSP does not disclose intervention data as it is for internal use only. However, data on currency swaps settled in foreign currency and nondeliverable forwards settled in domestic currency are reported monthly in Sections II and IV, respectively, of the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which is posted on the BSP website on a monthly basis. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The primary objective of the BSPʹs monetary policy is “to promote price stability conducive to a balanced and sustainable growth of the economy.” The adoption of the inflation-targeting framework of monetary policy in January 2002 was aimed at achieving this objective. The governmentʹs inflation target is defined in terms of the average year-over-year change in the consumer price index over the calendar year. The inflation targets have been set at 3.5% with a tolerance interval of ±1% for 2009 and 4.5% with a tolerance interval of ±1% for 2010."
2008,964,Poland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the zloty is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, and the zloty is traded freely against all currencies. The National Bank of Poland (NBP), however, reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market if it deems it necessary to stabilize inflation. This option has not been exercised in the past 10 years. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Monetary policy is based on a direct inflation-targeting strategy. Within the framework of this strategy, the Monetary Policy Council defines the inflation target and then adjusts the NBP basic interest rates in order to maximize the probability of achieving the target. The NBP has pursued a continuous inflation target at the level of 2.5% with a permissible fluctuation band of ±1%. A fixing rate is published every working day at 11:00 a.m. for information purposes."
2008,182,Portugal,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is independently floating. Portugal participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2009, 15 other members (previously, 14) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The ECB publishes a reference rate based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates. The monetary policy pursued by the ECB formally has two objectives: (1) an inflation rate below 2% and (2) a moderate growth of M3, with the former being dominant in practice."

2008,912,Republic of Azerbaijan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling band arrangement. After having appreciated the exchange rate against the dollar along a smooth path, starting March 11, 2008, the authorities fixed the value of the manat vis-à-vis a euro-dollar composite. The weights of the currencies in the composite were regularly changed to increase the weight of the euro. The CBA did not announce any fluctuation margins; in practice it aimed at managing the exchange rate within ±2% around the target trend, which is set annually. Thus, effective March 11, 2008, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a crawling peg to a crawling band. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a crawling band to other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology, which removed the category crawling band from the classification categories. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Starting June 1, 2008, the authorities have held the manat stable against the dollar. Therefore, as of June 1, 2008, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified from other managed arrangement to a stabilized arrangement."

The CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at the same rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also officially listed on the basis of the fixed rate for the euro and the rates for the foreign currencies prevailing on the Paris foreign exchange market.

The exchange rate of the won is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Korea (BOK) may intervene in the market with the funds of the BOK and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund when it is deemed necessary for the stability of the market. Interventions in the spot market or through derivatives in the forward market are not announced, and intervention data are not published. However, the authorities officially confirmed that the number of their interventions since October 1, 2008, is consistent with the definition of a free float. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology.

2008,943,Republic of Montenegro,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender.
2008,942,Republic of Serbia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. According to the 2009 Monetary Policy Program, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) implements a managed floating exchange rate regime. Interventions in the foreign exchange market take place only to smooth excessive daily fluctuations in the exchange rate for the dinar, in either direction (appreciation or depreciation), contain threats to financial and price stability, and safeguard an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves. Previously, the NBS strived to adjust its foreign exchange regime toward soft managed floating in order to smooth the path to a free-floating regime, which would enable an inflation-targeting framework for monetary policy. In accordance with its commitment, the NBS aims to reduce its participation in the market by implementing the policy of nonintervention. In the last quarter of 2008 and in the first two months of 2009, the NBS was forced to intervene in order to slow the depreciation of the dinar in exceptional circumstances and unstable foreign exchange market conditions caused by the spillover of the international financial crisis. Instability in global financial markets resulted in a sudden decrease in the level of household saving and a significant reduction in the portfolio of securities with the NBS, which has created increased demand for foreign currency and strong depreciation pressure despite a high key policy rate. The NBS does not regularly publish data on its intervention. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The official middle exchange rate of the dinar against the euro is calculated at the end of each business day as the weighted average of the exchange rates applied in all individual transactions in the interbank spot foreign exchange market outside the fixing session and in the fixing session on the same day. Effective July 1, 2008, the NBS publishes information on the official middle rate of the dinar against the euro by 6:00 p.m., to be effective at 8:00 a.m. on the following business day. Official middle exchange rates of the dinar against 16 currencies (which are quoted in the NBSʹs Exchange Rate List for official middle exchange rates) are used for the purposes of bookkeeping, statistics, and calculation of customs duty and other import fees, as provided by Article 41 of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations. In addition, exchange rates of the dinar against 10 currencies that are quoted in the NBSʹs Exchange Rate List for foreign exchange are used in the trade between the NBS and residents holding FCAs with the NBS. Finally, exchange rates of the dinar against three currencies that are quoted in the NBSʹs Exchange Rate List for foreign cash are used in trade between the NBS and licensed exchange dealers, as well as in cash trade between the NBS and banks. Exchange rates for foreign cash are also applied for the purposes of calculation and payments of foreign cash to residents holding FCAs with the NBS for the purposes of official travel. The NBS uses the two-week repo rate as the main monetary policy instrument to implement a monetary policy that is anchored by consumer price index inflation targets in the context of full-fledged inflation targeting introduced at end-2008. The core inflation corridor, which should help ensure the stability of the general level of prices in 2008, has been set between 3% and 6% a year."
2008,474,Republic of Yemen,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been free floating since July 1996. However, the rial has remained remarkably stable against the dollar within a 2% band. Thus, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a conventional pegged arrangement. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) receives most of the foreign exchange proceeds of the country, particularly crude oil export revenues, official loans, and official development assistance. The CBY regularly sells foreign exchange through auctions."
2008,299,República Bolivariana De Venezuela,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The bolívar is pegged to the dollar. Effective January 1, 2008, a monetary reconversion process was carried out in Venezuela, which eliminated three zeros from the national currency. The bolívar-dollar exchange rate is currently expressed as Bs 2.14 (buying) and Bs 2.15 (selling) per $1."
2008,968,Romania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) may intervene to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations based on its assessment of domestic and international market circumstances and on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The NBR quotes rates for 28 foreign currencies and the SDR. The exchange rates are based on the quotes of 10 local banks licensed to perform foreign exchange transactions. These banks are selected by the NBR taking into consideration their participation on the interbank foreign exchange market. The use of exchange rates listed by the NBR is not compulsory for foreign exchange transactions and accounting records. The NBR does not publish information on its interventions. The monetary framework is inflation targeting, and the NBR has an inflation target fixed at 3.5% for end-2009 with a ±1% band."
2008,922,Russian Federation,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement—namely, a controlled floating exchange rate arrangement. In 2008 the Bank of Russia (BR) proposed using the ruble value of a bi-currency basket as the operating benchmark for transactions on the internal currency exchange. The bi-currency basket, consisting of the dollar and the euro, has been used by the BR as an operating benchmark for currency interventions since 2005. Initially, the composition of the bi-currency basket was €0.10 and $0.90, but as the participants of the internal exchange market adapted to work under the new conditions, the BR revised its composition, increasing the euro share. The basket now is composed of €0.45 and $0.55. The target boundaries of its permissible fluctuations were revised in 2008 based on changes in fundamental factors governing formation of the countryʹs balance of payments in accordance with the Uniform State Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2008, in response to a gradual transition to a more flexible exchange-rate-setting policy. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008, the band of permissible fluctuation in the market value of the bi-currency basket grew to 16.9% from 0.59%, and between January 11, 2009, and January 23, 2009, it grew to 28.85% from 17.88% relative to the central exchange rate of the band. On January 23, 2009, the BR announced that the upper boundary of permissible fluctuation in the market value of the bi-currency basket would be set at Rub 41 and the lower boundary at Rub 26. The actual value of the bi-currency basket is determined within this band under the influence of both market factors and exchange interventions by the BR. The permissible fluctuations may be revised in response to changes in macroeconomic indicators. As a result of these policy changes and the continued control of the BR over the exchange rate determination, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed to other managed arrangement, effective November 1, 2008. The BR intervenes both on interbank currency exchanges and on the over-the-counter interbank market to limit daily fluctuations. The official exchange rates of foreign currencies against the ruble are set by the BR for calculating state budget revenues and expenditures; payments and settlements of state administration bodies with enterprises, organizations, and individuals; and taxation and accounting. The official exchange rate for each currency applies until the next official exchange rate becomes effective unless established otherwise by the BR. These rates are based on ruble quotes against the dollar on the internal exchange market and on quotes of other foreign currencies against the dollar on the global exchange market."
2008,714,Rwanda,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) sells francs at a predetermined reference price to market participants and the government. Due to the stability of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a conventional pegged arrangement. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. As of November 10, 2008, the NBRʹs reference rate is calculated daily as the weighted mean of five-day moving averages of commercial bank rates and the NBRʹs rate for the previous dayʹs operations to which a fixed margin of ±0.6% is applied to derive the selling and buying rates. The rate is determined every morning. The price formula used for determining the exchange rate ensured a gradual appreciation of the exchange rate until July 2008, at which point the direction of the exchange rate path reversed, with the pace of depreciation accelerating in January 2009. Therefore, the exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement on December 1, 2008. Effective January 16, 2009, the average reference rate is calculated as a 10-day weighted average. The NBR also pursues a monetary aggregate target."
2008,862,Samoa,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The exchange rate is officially determined on the basis of a fixed relationship with a weighted basket of currencies of Samoaʹs main trading partners, which, effective April 28, 2008, comprises the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and euro (previously, the Fiji dollar was also included in the basket). Effective March 30, 2009, the methodology for calculation of basket weights has been modified. The calculation of weights is now based on trade flows and tourism income flows; previously, it also included private remittances. Under the Central Bank of Samoa Act of 1984, the Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) is authorized to make discretionary exchange rate adjustments against the currency basket within a margin of ±2% when warranted. The CBS does not intervene directly in the foreign exchange market (via sales or purchases of foreign exchange) to maintain a fixed parity of the exchange rate. The central rate is calculated on a daily basis, and as such, it fluctuates according to the levels of the currencies in the basket each day."
2008,135,San Marino,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. San Marino has a monetary agreement with Italy, on behalf of the EU, that went into effect April 1, 2001, and (1) establishes that euro coins and banknotes are legal tender in San Marino; and (2) gives San Marino the authority to issue a certain number of euro coins, which are legal tender in the euro area and are equivalent in form to euro-area coinage."
2008,716,São Tomé and Príncipe,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The official buying exchange rate is determined on a daily basis weighted 40% by the average rate of commercial banks and 60% by the Banco Central de São Tomé e Príncipeʹs (BCSTPʹs) rate on the previous auction day, and applied to direct sales by the BCSTP to commercial banks. Rates for certain other currencies are determined on the basis of cross rates between the dollar and the currencies concerned in international markets. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to other managed arrangement retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Since February 1, 2009, the focus of the BCSTP switched from the dollar to the euro, which became the new reference currency. The CB scaled down its intervention on the foreign exchange market to build up reserves before the adoption of a formal peg to the euro, which is planned in 2010. Meanwhile, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from other managed arrangement, as of June 1, 2008, because of the stability of the dobra against the dollar and then vis-à-vis the euro. The monetary policy aims at controlling dobra base money."
2008,456,Saudi Arabia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The exchange rate of the riyal is pegged to the dollar at the official rate of SRl 3.75 per $1 with a midpoint of SRl 3.745 per $1. The rate of the riyal against the dollar is determined by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) and has been stable since June 1986.
2008,722,Senegal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"Senegal participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at a rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris exchange market vis-à-vis the euro."
2008,718,Seychelles,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Before November 1, 2008, the rupee was pegged to a weighted basket of currencies of main Seychelles trading and tourism partners, with the following respective weights: euro (59.1%), pound sterling (30.2%), and dollar (10.7%). Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Since November 1, 2008, the exchange rate of the rupee is determined by market forces, with the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) intervening only to smooth exchange rate volatility and manage liquidity. Thus, effective this date, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed to floating from stabilized. Operational guidelines specify the role of the CBS as the buyer/seller of last resort in the foreign exchange market. The operational target of the monetary policy is reserve money."
2008,724,Sierra Leone,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, with the exchange rate of the leone determined by the market. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The leone started experiencing a pronounced depreciation in the third quarter of 2008, which continued thereafter. The depreciation is a result of the second-round effects of the current financial turmoil, which has significantly affected the tradable sector, and the reduction in remittances from the diaspora. There are no policies in place aimed at targeting a specific level for the exchange rate nor is the exchange rate arrangement characterized by frequent shifts in policies. The auction, though used as a reference rate by market participants, constitutes only about 7% of official foreign exchange transactions and does not influence the exchange rate. Therefore, effective November 1, 2008, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement. The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) determines the exchange rate used in official transactions, including for customs valuation purposes; the rate is based on the weighted average midrate of purchases and sales made by commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus during the preceding five business days, including the weekly auction rate. The monetary policy of the BSL aims to control monetary aggregates."
2008,576,Singapore,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The authorities manage the exchange rate as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the objective of promoting price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. The Singapore dollar is allowed to fluctuate within a targeted policy band and is managed against a basket of currencies of the countryʹs major trading partners and competitors. The various currencies are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the country to Singaporeʹs trade relations with the world. The exchange rate policy is announced every six months in the Monetary Policy Statement, typically in terms of changes to the slope of the policy band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) does not publish information on its interventions. The monetary policy of the MAS is guided by an exchange rate target."
2008,936,Slovak Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Effective January 1, 2009, the Slovak Republic participates in a currency union with 15 other members of the EMU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. Thus, effective January 1, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement of the Slovak Republic has been reclassified to the category independently floating from the category pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Previously, the Slovak Republic entered into the ERM II, pegging the koruna to the euro at the central rate of Sk 38.4550 per €1, which was later adjusted to Sk 35.4424 per €1 with a standard fluctuation band of ±15% around the central rate of the koruna. The ECB publishes information on its interventions but it has not intervened since 2000. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement of the EMU has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies.

The exchange rate of the Solomon Islands dollar is calculated on the basis of a basket of foreign currencies but further managed by the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) through interventions on a daily basis to determine its value vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The method of exchange rate calculation has not changed, but because of daily interventions by the CBSI, the Solomon Islands dollar has depreciated against the U.S. dollar since June 2008. Therefore, effective June 1, 2008, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a conventional peg. The CBSI determines the exchange rate of the Solomon Islands dollar against the U.S. dollar with mandatory spread limits; however, the commercial banks determine the exchange rates for other currencies."

The authorities allowed some limited floating of the rupee beginning around the middle of December 2008. Since then, the exchange rate of the rupee has been more volatile. Therefore, effective January 1, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement. The CBSL does not release data on its interventions. The CBSL computes the weighted average interbank rate on a daily basis."
2008,361,St. Kitts and Nevis,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Kitts and Nevis participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement at EC$2.70 per US$1. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, though, in practice, the coverage has been about 100%."

2008,732,Sudan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate is determined in the interbank market, in which participants deal directly with each other. The Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) participates in the market through swaps under a rules-based mechanism that triggers intervention when the exchange rate exceeds a band within ±3% of the previous dayʹs closing rate. The main objective of the policy is to ensure the stability and flexibility of the exchange rate. Effective January 7, 2008, the spread between the buying and selling rates has been set as a percentage instead of a fixed amount; the spread is a percentage of the official exchange rate. The CBOS announces selling, buying, and middle foreign exchange rates. The CBOS does not disclose information on its interventions to the public. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The monetary policy aims to control the monetary aggregates."
2008,366,Suriname,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. According to a July 1994 presidential decree, the exchange rate is to be determined based on demand and supply. Monetary and fiscal policies are geared toward exchange rate stabilization. As a result, the exchange rate of the Surinamese dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official and parallel markets has remained stable at around SRD 2.80 per US$1 since 2003. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The official exchange rate is pegged at SRD 2.75 per US$1. In the event of a persistent discrepancy between the official rate and the rates quoted by commercial banks and nonbank institutions, the official rate is adjusted to reflect the prevailing market conditions."
2008,734,Swaziland,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The lilangeni is pegged to the South African rand at E 1 per R 1. Exchange rates for the U.S. dollar quoted by the Central Bank of Swaziland (CBS) are based on the exchange rate of the South African rand against the U.S. dollar. Rates are also quoted for the Canadian dollar, euro, Japanese yen, pound sterling, and Swiss franc, based on the London and New York market quotations for these currencies against the U.S. dollar."
2008,144,Sweden,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the krona is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are allowed under extraordinary circumstances, e.g., participation in concerted interventions with other CBs. The Sveriges Riksbank announces its intervention in a press communiqué, explains the motive, and discloses the framework of intervention. However, no intervention was reported in 2008. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The monetary framework is inflation targeting. The inflation target has been defined as keeping the annual rise in the consumer price index at 2%, with a tolerance range of ±1 percentage point around this target."
2008,146,Switzerland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free market rates. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. On March 12, 2009, the SNB announced its intention to act in order to prevent any further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro and to intervene in the foreign exchange market to this effect. Monetary policy implementation is based on an explicit definition of price stability—an annual consumer price index inflation rate under 2%—as a long-term anchor. Policy decisions are guided by an inflation forecast over a three-year horizon. As an operational objective, the SNB announced a target range for the three-month Swiss franc LIBOR determined offshore. The SNB attempts to indirectly steer the LIBOR generally to the middle of this band, in particular by conducting repo transactions. A key communication device is an inflation forecast chart that indicates the SNBʹs policy bias. The use of LIBOR as an operational target stems from its considerable economic significance as a reference rate for many financial and lending contracts, including flexible-rate mortgages."
2008,463,Syrian Arab Republic,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Since the revaluation of the pound against the dollar, the official rate is pegged to the SDR within a ±9% band."
2008,923,Tajikistan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange arrangement is managed floating. The exchange rate of the somoni is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, in which the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) may intervene to limit exchange rate volatility. The NBT does not release data on its interventions. As a result of these interventions, the somoni exchange rate was very stable until January 2008. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The exchange rate depreciated by 14% from January 1, 2009, to April 30, 2009, and the NBT announced a flexible foreign exchange arrangement. As a result, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from stabilized as of January 1, 2009. The official exchange rate of the somoni against the dollar is determined and set daily by the NBT on the basis of the weighted average exchange rates of dollar transactions in the interbank and intrabank foreign exchange markets as of 3:00 p.m. Exchange rates for other currencies are determined indirectly through cross-exchange rates of the dollar against these currencies. The official exchange rate is used for purposes of accounting and customs payments and does not serve as a basis for authorized banksʹ exchange rate in transactions with their clients. The official exchange rate is established without any obligation on the part of the NBT to purchase or sell currency at that exchange rate. The NBT aims to control monetary aggregates."
2008,738,Tanzania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bank of Tanzania (BOT) is the predominant supplier of foreign exchange in a rather shallow market. It has been almost exclusively on the selling side in the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM), in order to sterilize liquidity generated by government spending financed by official inflows. The amount of the BOTʹs foreign exchange sales has varied to avoid disruptive exchange rate fluctuations. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The BOT discloses information on its interventions. The official exchange rate is determined as the average of the buy and sell rates in the IFEM. The operational targets of the monetary policy are monetary aggregates."
2008,578,Thailand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the baht is determined in the foreign exchange market. The baht-dollar reference exchange rate is announced daily, based on the weighted average exchange rate of the previous day. The baht-dollar reference exchange rate is widely used as a benchmark rate for marking to market the dollars held by funds and corporations as well as for calculating profit and loss as a result of foreign exchange transactions for accounting purposes. The Bank of Thailand (BOT) also uses the baht-dollar reference exchange rate to mark to market its foreign exchange reserves. The authorities intervene in the foreign exchange market as conditions require. The BOT does not disclose information on its interventions. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The BOT has a formal inflation target of zero to 3.5% on a quarterly basis. It uses the one-day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the key policy rate to signal the monetary policy stance."

2008,648,The Gambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the dalasi is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Gambia participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the dalasi and the dollar be maintained within ±15% around the central rate. However, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures. The Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange. Such intervention has aimed to augment international reserves or reduce volatility in exchange rate movements. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The CBGʹs monetary operational target is reserve money."
2008,742,Togo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"Togo participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the rate of CFAF 655.957 per €1. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro."
2008,866,Tonga,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. The external value of the paʹanga is determined on the basis of a weighted basket of currencies comprising the Australian dollar, yen, New Zealand dollar, and U.S. dollar. The exchange rate of the paʹanga in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed monthly by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) within a band of ±5%."
2008,369,Trinidad and Tobago,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. In 2008, the exchange rate moved between TT$6.1573 and TT$6.3573 per US$1 until June 30, 2008. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Effective July 1, 2008, the Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) de facto pegged the Trinidad and Tobago dollar to a basket and later reverted to a peg to the U.S. dollar, effective September 1, 2008. Although the exchange rate classification hasnʹt changed, the anchor currency, with respect to which the exchange rate is stabilized, was changed to a composite from the U.S. dollar, effective July 1 through August 31, and to the U.S. dollar from a composite, effective September 1, 2008."
2008,744,Tunisia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The exchange rate of the dinar is determined in the interbank market. The Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to regulate foreign exchange demand and supply and publishes daily an indicative interbank exchange rate for the dinar against the main international foreign currencies. The dinar was very stable against a constant euro-dollar composite until January 2008. Since then the dinar has been more flexible against the euro and the dollar. Therefore, effective January 1, 2008, the exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate from a conventional peg. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The CBT applies a quantitative approach on the monetary basis, which is the operational target, and fine-tunes bank liquidity with open-market operations. The CBT does not release data on its interventions. The exchange rate of the dinar posted to the market by the CBT is purely indicative. Transactions in the foreign exchange market are conducted at exchange rates freely negotiated by banks."

The exchange rate of the lira is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market in case of excessive volatility in the exchange rates. The CBRT suspended its daily buying auctions on October 16, 2008. Daily selling auctions to provide dollars to the market were held from October 24 through October 30 in 2008 (a total of $100 million was sold) and then again from March 10, 2009, through April 2, 2009, for $50 million each day. As a result, the exchange rate arrangement of Turkey has been reclassified to floating from freely floating as of October 24, 2008. The CBRT publishes results of its currently suspended daily auctions on its website. The CBRT has a formal inflation-targeting framework. The target was 4% in 2008, and was revised to 7.5% for 2009 on June 2, 2008."
2008,925,Turkmenistan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The exchange rate (cash and noncash) is determined through weekly foreign currency auctions held by the Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT), in which authorized commercial banks participate. Effective January 1, 2008, the official exchange rate was devalued to TMM 6,250 per $1 from TMM 5,200 per $1, and a commercial rate of TMM 20,000 per $1 was introduced for transactions not eligible for foreign exchange at the official rate. Effective May 1, 2008, the official and the commercial rates were unified, and the manat was pegged to the dollar at a rate of TMM 14,250 per $1. Following the redenomination of the currency on January 1, 2009, the exchange rate is TMT 2.85 per $1."
2008,746,Uganda,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The authorities intervene in Ugandaʹs shallow foreign exchange market when short-term fluctuations in inflows jeopardize its orderly operation. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) publishes information on its interventions in regular reports. The daily official exchange rate is calculated as the midrate of the weighted interbank exchange rates for purchases and sales of foreign exchange. The weights are based on each bankʹs volume of foreign exchange purchased or sold. It is used by the customs authority for tax computation on imports, BOU transactions with state-owned and commercial banks, and exchange rate monitoring. The main operational target of the BOUʹs monetary policy is reserve money."
2008,926,Ukraine,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. In accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine and the Law on the National Bank of Ukraine, the main function of the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU) is to provide for stability of the domestic monetary unit. To this end, the NBU influences the exchange rate without planning a specific path or exchange rate target. Exchange rate adjustments are not automatic in nature. Interventions may be both direct and indirect. Previously, the hryvnia exchange rate was kept within a very narrow range in relation to the dollar as a result of interventions; greater flexibility in the exchange rate was seen in early 2008. In light of this, the classification of the de facto exchange arrangement was changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate as of April 30, 2008. As of December 29, 2008, the NBU fixed the official exchange rate of the hryvnia against the dollar at HRV 7.7 per $1 and resorted to interventions with the aim of keeping the market exchange rate close to the official rate. The NBU publishes information about its interventions in the interbank market. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other exchange rate policies. The official exchange rate of the hryvnia against foreign currencies and bank metals is used by residents and nonresidents to account for transactions with foreign exchange and bank metals and for the execution of transactions by the NBU with the State Treasury of Ukraine. The Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF provides for a transition to a flexible exchange arrangement for the hryvnia. In accordance with this, the operational target indicators for the countryʹs monetary policy are the monetary aggregate (base money) and observance of the floor on international reserves."
2008,466,United Arab Emirates,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dirham is pegged to the dollar, the intervention currency, at Dh 3.6725 per $1."
2008,112,United Kingdom,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the pound sterling is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of England (BOE) has a separate pool of foreign exchange reserves, which it may use at its discretion to intervene in support of its monetary policy objective. The BOE does not announce its interventions but a monthly press release issued by Her Majestyʹs Treasury (HMT) reports HMT and BOE intervention. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The BOE pursues an explicit inflation target—currently 2%. It seeks to meet the inflation target through the Monetary Policy Committeeʹs decisions on interest rates."
2008,111,United States,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the dollar is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are not formally ruled out in the United States, but they are rarely used. The secretary of the treasury is responsible for the formulation and implementation of international monetary and financial policy, including exchange market intervention policy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has separate legal authority to engage in foreign exchange operations. The Fedʹs foreign exchange operations are conducted in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury to ensure consistency with U.S. international monetary and financial policy. The Treasury and the Fed have closely coordinated their foreign exchange operations since early 1962, when the Fed commenced such operations at the request of the Treasury. Operations are conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as fiscal agent of the United States and as the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. Interventions are reported in the Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations quarterly bulletin. There were no interventions during 2008. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to free floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The monetary policy aims at maintaining long-run growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economyʹs long-run potential to increase production and promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates."
2008,298,Uruguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Uruguayan peso is determined on the basis of supply and demand, although the CBU reserves the right to intervene to avert abrupt changes in a concentrated market with few transactions. The dollar is the intervention currency. The CBU publishes information on interventions on its website. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to floating, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The monetary policy framework is inflation targeting, although a formal inflation-targeting framework is not in place yet."
2008,927,Uzbekistan,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The exchange rate of the dollar is determined on the basis of interbank trading sessions (ITS). Effective March 13, 2008, ITS also include euro operations. The sum has gradually depreciated against the dollar. The official exchange rate of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is determined once a week as the average ITS rate for the previous week, and it remains in effect for one week. The official exchange rate of the CBU is used for accounting purposes, for statistical and other reporting on foreign exchange operations, and for the calculation of customs and other mandatory payments in the territory of Uzbekistan."
2008,846,Vanuatu,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Officially, the external value of the vatu is determined on the basis of an undisclosed transaction-weighted (trade and tourism receipts) basket of currencies of Vanuatuʹs major trading partners. In practice, the vatu has experienced significant volatility against possible currency composites. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) quotes vatu rates daily against the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, euro, yen, New Zealand dollar, and pound sterling. Buying and selling rates of the vatu against the currencies in the basket are quoted once a day within margins ranging between 0.25% and 0.30% around the middle rate."
2008,582,Vietnam,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) announces the daily average interbank exchange rate against the dollar; authorized credit institutions base their bid and offer quotes on this rate. The official exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand of foreign exchange in the market. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to a stabilized arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. Effective November 7, 2008, the SBV has widened the dong-dollar trading band, allowing banks to trade within ±3% of the rate quoted by the SBV. Previously, the band had been widened to ±1% on March 10, 2008. There is no preannounced path for the central rate. Accordingly, the exchange rate fluctuation increased in 2008. Therefore, effective November 8, 2008, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement. The SBV does not release intervention data. The official rate applied to purchases of foreign currency from the government generally is the interbank average exchange rate."
2008,754,Zambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is free floating. The official exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) intervenes in the market primarily through transactions with ADs, which are all registered commercial banks. Effective January 1, 2008, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to independently floating, as a result of reduced interventions on the interbank market. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from independently floating to floating retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The interbank rates provide the basis for determining the BOZ exchange rates: the BOZʹs buying rate is the simple average of the primary dealersʹ low-bid rates, and the BOZʹs selling rate is the simple average of the primary dealersʹ high-offer rates. The BOZʹs monetary policy aims to control the monetary aggregates."
2008,698,Zimbabwe,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The exchange rate is independently floating in the interbank market. Effective April 30, 2008, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement was changed from a conventional pegged arrangement to managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate because of the coexistence of different currencies in Zimbabwe and frequent changes in policy regarding the Zimbabwe dollar. Effective February 2, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed from managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate to other managed arrangement, retroactively to April 30, 2008, due to the revision of the classification methodology. Thus, the change reflects only a methodological modification and does not imply a judgment that there has been a substantive alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. For accounting and customs valuation, Zimbabwe authorities use the South African rand."
2009,914,Albania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lek is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) normally is not active in this market. Per its regulations, intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) Severe and adverse movements in the exchange rate of the lek; these are cases of excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market: Such situations are considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementation of Monetary Policy, which seeks to avoid intervening in the foreign exchange market. However, lack of depth in the foreign exchange market accompanied by pronounced seasonal factors (i.e., seasonal increases in the supply of foreign currency in the summer months and in December and stronger imports during the first part of the year) can result in fast one-way movements, which may disrupt activity in the domestic foreign exchange market. The bid-ask spreads may widen up to 1%, and at times banks do not deal with each other at all. In such circumstances, intervention may be used to restore calm to a disorderly market and to smooth the seasonal trends. (2) Considerable exchange rate misalignment with fundamentals: The lek is considered misaligned with fundamentals if there is a lengthy overshooting of the exchange rate. Interventions have not occurred for this reason. (3) A need to accumulate foreign reserves to meet the net international reserves (NIR) target: The NIR target is included each year in the BOAʹs monetary program. When the BOA intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange markets, its counterparties are the commercial banks, but when necessary, the BOA may carry out its interventions with foreign exchange bureaus. The BOA conducts interventions through (1) verbal interventions, in the form of press releases in the written or electronic media and/or press conferences; and (2) transactional interventions. The intervention exchange rate is determined by commercial banksʹ quotes and the BOA Monetary Operations Departmentʹs quotes. When the intervention exchange rate is uniform for all counterparties, the BOA publishes that rate on its Reuters page and, at the same time, communicates the exchange rate to the commercial banks that do not participate in the Reuters system and to the foreign exchange bureaus with which it has contacts. When different exchange rates are used, the BOA announces only the fact that it has intervened; it publishes with a three-month lag the amount of the intervention in a quarterly bulletin that summarizes its foreign exchange operations with banks and the public sector. Effective February 15, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed to floating from free floating because of the BOAʹs intervention in February 2009 in the foreign exchange market to deal with rapid change in the lek exchange rate. The BOA sets the official rate of the lek against the dollar and the euro every day, based on rates quoted by the most active and prominent domestic foreign exchange market operators. Exchange rates for currencies other than the dollar and the euro are calculated on the basis of dollar cross rates observed in international foreign exchange markets. The official rate of the lek vis-à-vis the principal foreign currencies is the rate used in settling customs obligations and in revaluing the foreign exchange positions of the BOA. Participants in the domestic foreign exchange market have no legal obligation to use the official rate in their transactions; however, the BOA requires commercial banks to use the official rate in converting foreign currency positions reported in their monthly balance sheet data. The primary monetary policy objective of the BOA is “to achieve and maintain price stability.” Currently, the BOA is committed to maintaining the inflation rate at 3%, within a fluctuation band of ±1%. Inflation is estimated as the annual growth of the consumer price index (CPI) as measured and published by INSTAT. The monetary policy of the BOA is guided by a broad-based assessment of current and expected economic and financial conditions and their implications for CPI inflation as well as for the performance of the money supply (M3 monetary aggregate). In setting its monetary policy stance, the BOA bases its decisions on inflation forecasts. In order to achieve its final objective, the BOA sets the operational framework of monetary policy instruments used to intervene in the money market. It employs instruments used in open-market operations, standing facilities, and other liquidity-providing instruments."
2009,612,Algeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating with no predetermined path for the exchange rate. The external value of the dinar is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Bank of Algeria (BA) is the main seller because of the significant inflows related to commodity exports, including hydrocarbons, which, under current law, must be surrendered to the BA. The BA manages the dinar with reference to a basket of currencies. The rate of the dinar relative to the currencies in the basket is based on balance of payments data. As a result of the BA policy of tracking a composite, effective January 1, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from floating. The BA does not disclose any information about its interventions. There is no official exchange rate determined outside the market."
2009,614,Angola,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. However, the BNA intervenes actively in the foreign exchange market in order to sterilize foreign currency inflows in the form of taxes paid by oil companies. The BNA intervenes in the primary foreign exchange market exclusively through foreign exchange auctions. Although it announces the volume for sale before the auction, the BNA has a policy to hold as many auctions a day as needed to satisfy the entire demand, which led to the stability of the kwanza exchange rate. Effective April 20, 2009, auctions were temporarily suspended until October 2, 2009, leading to the establishment of a formal peg. Since resumption of auctions, the kwanza depreciated from Kz 78 per dollar to 93 Kz per dollar at end-April 2010. However, the authorities maintain strong control over the exchange rate. As a result, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective October 2, 2009. The BNA does not publish data on its interventions. The main monetary anchor remains the exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar, although the BNA also has a monetary program in the context of an IMF-supported program. The reference currency is the dollar. The BNA publishes a reference rate daily. The reference exchange rate is calculated as follows: When the BNA is a buyer only, the buying reference rate is the weighted average of exchange rates paid by the BNA, and the selling exchange rate of the auction sessions is calculated by adding a percentage to the buying rate, to be determined by the BNA. When the BNA is the seller, the selling reference rate is the weighted average of the rates paid by the banks, and the buying rate is calculated by subtracting a percentage from the selling rate. The reference rate is applied to transactions in goods, capital, and current invisibles, pursuant to the current legislation. (Instruction No. 10/2009 of 09/30 and Directive No. 03/DGR/2009 of 10/01) The nominal anchor for monetary policy is the exchange rate, which is continuously monitored by the BNA."

The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement at EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2009,213,Argentina,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, and the exchange rate of the peso, which is determined in the MULC by the interplay of supply and demand, is applied to all transactions in foreign exchange and foreign currency banknotes. The BCRA intervenes in the foreign exchange market each business day to execute its reserve accumulation and management policy, which acts as a stabilizer in the event of temporary changes in external financial conditions. The BCRA publishes its net purchases in a weekly foreign exchange report. The peso has been more volatile since September 2008; it depreciated by 21% from September 2008 to April 2009. As a result, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Before the beginning of each year, the BCRA announces its monetary program and the projected total change in money stock. Each quarter, the BCRA publishes a report that tracks compliance with the monetary policy target. By Communication A 3500, the BCRA established the mechanisms for calculating the reference exchange rate (TCR) on each banking day for wholesale operations that can be settled in pesos and dollars on the date of the quote. The TCR is intended to reflect the wholesale market price on each day, taking into account the “best” available quotes for operators accessing the market. The highest and lowest rates are excluded from the calculation of the wholesale exchange rate. Requests for quotes are made in three daily rounds: between 10:00 and 10:59 a.m., between 12:00 and 12:59 p.m., and between 2:00 and 2:59 p.m. The TCR is for information purposes only and may be used by the market as a benchmark for different purposes. The forward exchange rate markets use the TCR published by the BCRA."
2009,911,Armenia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. As of March 3, 2009, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) decided to limit its role as a supplier in the foreign exchange market, thus returning to a de facto floating exchange rate regime. This allows the exchange rate to find a level more in line with existing macroeconomic fundamentals. The CBA intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility, which is defined as short-term/high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by speculative or trend-following elements, rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals, which impose significant costs on the Armenian economy. The CBA publishes weekly intervention data on its website with a one-week lag. Reflecting recent exchange rate developments, in particular the absence of CBA interventions, effective March 3, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement. Since March 2009, the CBA has been active in the foreign exchange market, resulting in limited exchange rate flexibility; nonetheless, the exchange rate remained more volatile than the minimum required for a stabilized arrangement. The official exchange rate is set as the weighted average of the buying and selling rates in the foreign exchange market and is used for accounting purposes and for treasury operations that are connected with external debt service or create new external obligations. Foreign exchange entities use the official exchange rate for bookkeeping and revaluation purposes. The CBA pursues a policy of inflation targeting (IT) “light,” with the objective of moving to full-fledged IT over the medium"

The Central Bank van Aruba (CBA) deals with local commercial banks within margins of 0.002795% on either side of parity. The legal documents that established the fixed exchange rate arrangement are AB 1992 No. GT 6 State Decree for Fixing Parity of the Aruban florin and Notice on Foreign Exchange Transactions 90/A2. The government of Aruba may decide to change the exchange rate arrangement.
2009,193,Australia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the RBA retains discretionary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The RBA may also vary the way the intervention is conducted; it may enter the interbank foreign exchange market directly through the electronic brokerage market or use an agent bank. Given the high level of development of the Australian foreign exchange market, interventions are rare. As a matter of government policy, all wholesale purchases of foreign currency by government agencies are made through the RBA. The policy of the RBA is to cover sales of foreign currency to the government as soon as practicable. There is no official CB fixed rate for the Australian dollar. However, the legal and commercial reference rate against the U.S. dollar, which is often used in private contracts, is the WM/Reuters Australian dollar fixing rate at 10 a.m. Australian Eastern Standard Time (AEST), calculated hourly from market rates. The 10:00 a.m. AEST rate is typically used in private contracts where a fixing rate is required. For public information, the RBA publishes an Australian dollar–U.S. dollar reference rate based on the 4:00 p.m. AEST WM/Reuters Australian dollar fixing rate and also publishes the trade-weighted index of the Australian dollar based on market rates at 4:00 p.m. The current de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. Monthly purchases and sales of foreign exchange are published on the CB website. The monetary framework is inflation targeting. The governor and the treasurer have agreed that the appropriate target for monetary policy in Australia is to achieve an inflation rate of 2% to 3%, on average, over the cycle. The inflation target is defined as a medium-term average rather than as a rate (or band of rates) that must be held at all times. This formulation allows for the inevitable uncertainties involved in forecasting and the lags in the effects of monetary policy on the economy."

The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. The ECB publishes a reference rate based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates. To maintain price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem and of the single monetary policy for which it is responsible. This is stated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 127(1). “Without prejudice to the objective of price stability,” the Eurosystem will also “support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community.” These include a “high level of employment” and “sustainable and non-inflationary growth.” Price stability is defined as an inflation rate below but close to 2%."

2009,913,Belarus,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is a pegged exchange rate within a horizontal band. Since January 2, 2009, the exchange rate of the rubel has been pegged to a basket of currencies, including the euro, the dollar, and the Russian ruble. Initially, the band was set at ±5%. As of June 22, 2009 the band was expanded to ±10% relative to the value of the basket at the time of its introduction (960 rubels per dollar). From January 2009 to January 2010, the rubel depreciated by 7.9%. Effective January 1, 2010, the central exchange rate of the band was adjusted to the rubel actual rate (1,036 rubels per dollar) from the initial rate. Since January 2, 2009, the actual value of the rubel has remained within the established exchange rate bands. Thus, effective January 2, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands from a stabilized arrangement. The NBRB does not publish data on its interventions. The value of the basket is calculated as the geometric mean with equal weights for the currencies constituting the basket. The calculation of the value of the basket is based on the official exchange rates of rubel against the dollar, the euro, and the Russian ruble.

2009,218,Bolivia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"""Boliviaʹs de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg to the dollar, characterized by small fluctuations for which no prior notice is given. The Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) determines the floor price on the daily competitive foreign exchange auctions (bolsín) in which the financial system participates. The floor selling price at foreign exchange auctions constitutes the official exchange rate, which is used in official transactions, whereas the buying rate (10 cents less than the official rate) is used for valuation and accounting purposes. The CBB aims to ensure a rate consistent with moderate inflation and to mitigate external and internal inflation pressure. The exchange rate is still used as a benchmark for the price of nontradable goods. With the underpinning of a strong external position, the CBB allowed the value of the domestic currency to appreciate from 2006 to October 2008, based on sound economic fundamentals. This steady appreciation contributed to the bolivianization of the national economy. The rate of crawl is equal to zero because the authorities view the stability of the exchange rate as a response to the sound fundamentals of the Bolivian economy. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement against the dollar from a crawling peg, effective October 6, 2008. The CBB publishes data on its exchange market interventions and on its purchases and sales of foreign exchange in the “Weekly Statistics” section of its website."

The exchange rate is fixed by Article 12 of the MCA of November 23, 1972, between the BEAC and France, which states that the par value can be modified following consultation among the signatory states (BEAC members and France), taking into account the demands of the economic and financial situation of the member states. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory states (“Joint Monetary Committee”) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to renounce the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of any member state from the BEAC automatically results in that member stateʹs renunciation of the MCA."
2009,228,Chile,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate of the peso is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Chile (CBC) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market to keep the currency near its equilibrium value in order to avoid costly reversals in the future. These interventions take the form of transparent, well-founded measures, which include explicit definitions of the periods and amounts involved and clearly explained reasons for these exceptional interventions. The CBC usually announces the amount of foreign exchange it intends to buy or sell in its monthly bulletin. In 2008, in particular, the CBC conducted a special auction program to buy $8 billion, which was suspended owing to worsening conditions on world financial markets. Acting as fiscal agent, the CBC implemented two auction programs in 2009 to sell foreign exchange on behalf of Chileʹs revenue department. The first auction of $3 billion was held between March 27 and June 23, 2009, and the second auction of $4 billion ran from July 1 to November 20, 2009. The CBC publishes its reserves on a weekly basis. The CBC pursues an inflation-targeting approach to monetary policy. Since 2007, the explicit objective of the CBC has been to maintain annual inflation of the consumer price index at about 3% most of the time, with a tolerance range of ±1%. This objective should be permanently achieved within a medium-term horizon of two years. The CBC publishes in the Official Gazette daily exchange rates of the foreign currencies generally accepted in international exchange markets, based on the previous dayʹs transactions on the Formal Exchange Market (MCF) and, where appropriate, on any reports it may obtain on transactions recorded on international markets. The CBC also publishes a daily exchange rate called the dólar acuerdo (agreed dollar rate) effective on the day before the release of the publication, which is determined on the basis of the procedure or rules stated in the annex to Chapter I of the Compendium of International Exchange Standards (CNCI) and on Decree No. 309 issued by the MOF."
2009,233,Colombia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. All foreign exchange transactions are conducted at a market-determined exchange rate; however, the Banco de la República (BR) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to adjust the level of international reserves, limit excess volatility of the exchange rate, and influence the speed of adjustment of the nominal exchange rate. The BR, in a press release, stated that it would re-start the accumulation of international reserves because of signs of exchange rate misalignment, and to this end, it would purchase US$20 million/day from March through June 30, 2010. The regulations governing BR intervention state that the BR may intervene in the exchange market at its discretion or in compliance with the rules established by the board of directors. The monthly results of the BRʹs intervention on the foreign exchange market and information regarding each auction are available on the BRʹs website. The tasa representativa del mercado (market representative rate, TRM) is the official economic indicator of the peso vis-à-vis the dollar. The indicator is calculated as the simple arithmetic average of the weighted rates of foreign exchange purchases and sales carried out by financial institutions in the main cities of the country for settlement in both currencies on the same day. The market indicator is currently calculated and certified daily by the Financial Superintendency (SF) of Colombia, based on the financial transactions reported for the previous business day. The indicator is used as the reference for the quotation and settlement of foreign exchange transactions, for operations indexed to the dollar, and for the conversion of accounts in foreign currency into local currency. The BR uses the indicator for the settlement of foreign exchange options. The monetary policy framework is inflation targeting. The inflation target range for 2009 was between 4.5% and 5.5% (3.5% and 4.5%, respectively, for 2008). The long-term inflation target range is between 2.0% and 4.0%."

Exchange rates are officially quoted on the basis of the fixed rate of the Comorian franc for the euro and the Paris exchange market rates for other currencies. The monetary cooperation agreement established between CAEMC member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. The exchange rate arrangement is established in the following documents: (1) the Monetary Cooperation Agreement between the Comoros and French governments, November 23, 1979; (2) the decision by the European Council of Ministers authorizing France to maintain its monetary arrangements with both the CFA zone countries and the Comoros, November 23, 1998; and (3) the order by the governor of the Central Bank of Comoros (CBC) on the euro-Comorian franc parity, January 14, 1999.

2009,238,Costa Rica,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"""Since October 17, 2006, the de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a crawling band arrangement with an increasing but moderate width. The band is defined in terms of colones per dollar and does not include a central parity. The edges of the band are changed to allow the exchange rate greater room to respond continuously to economic fundamentals and to short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. Effective January 22, 2009, the intervention selling exchange rate was set at C 563.25 per dollar (previously, 562.83 per dollar). The intervention buying exchange rate was left unchanged at C 500.00, thereby widening the band to 12.6%. Effective January 23, 2009, the crawl rate of the bandʹs ceiling has been set at C 0.20 (previously, C 0.06) a business day, resulting in an annual rate of depreciation of about 9%. The daily exchange rate calculated in the Foreign Exchange Market (MONEX) corresponds to the weighted average of the effective price of all transactions made during the session. The Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR) publishes its intervention data weekly. In the first seven months of 2009, the BCCR intervened on the foreign exchange market to protect the fluctuation bandʹs ceiling. However, since August 12, 2009, the average exchange rate on the MONEX has been below the bandʹs ceiling, indicating an appreciation of the local currency. Since then, the BCCR has not intervened in the MONEX."

2009,960,Croatia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating without a predetermined path. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) may set intervention exchange rates, which it applies in transactions with banks outside the interbank market to limit exchange rate volatility. The exchange rate of the kuna vis-à-vis the euro remained broadly stable in 2008, but it depreciated by approximately 3% in December 2008 and again in January 2009. The kuna subsequently regained most of its lost ground vis-à-vis the euro, reflecting improvements in foreign exchange market conditions and the CNBʹs purchases of foreign exchange on several occasions. Since July 2009, the kuna has been stable against the euro. As a result, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective July 1, 2009. Intervention data (prices and volumes) are published on the CNB website. The monetary policy aims at stability of the kuna vis-à-vis the euro. The reference exchange rate published daily by the CNB is based on the stipulated turnover and foreign currency exchange rates in the foreign exchange market. The kuna-euro midpoint exchange rate is the arithmetic mean of the weighted buying and selling exchange rate of banks. The reference exchange rate is used by market participants for statistical purposes."
2009,423,Cyprus,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating.

The euro floats freely and independently against other currencies. As a result, effective January 1, 2008, the de facto exchange rate arrangement of Cyprus has been reclassified to the category independently floating from the category pegged exchange rate within a horizontal band. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. The ECB publishes a reference rate based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates. To maintain price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem and of the single monetary policy for which it is responsible. This is stated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 127(1). “Without prejudice to the objective of price stability,” the Eurosystem will also “support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community.” These include a “high level of employment” and “sustainable and non-inflationary growth.” Price stability is defined as an inflation rate below but close to 2%."
2009,935,Czech Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The external value of the koruna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) participates. The CNB pursues a program of sales of foreign exchange reserves revenues aimed at preventing the level of reserves from continuing to rise. The CNB publishes its monthly foreign exchange transaction data on its website, with a two-month lag. The CNB fixes foreign exchange market rates on the basis of its monitoring of the movements of currencies on the interbank foreign exchange market. The CNB publishes daily rates of 34 selected currencies against the koruna for customs and accounting purposes. The published exchange rates correspond to the trading in individual currencies on the foreign exchange market at 2:15 p.m. local time. Under the Act on Accounting and other legal norms, the exchange rates are used for nontrading purposes (i.e., for valuing assets and liabilities, tax and customs proceedings, etc). See www.cnb.cz/en/faq/faq_o4.html. The CNBʹs primary objective is to maintain price stability. Without prejudice to its primary objective, the CNB also supports the general economic policies of the government. The CNB achieves its primary objective by making changes to key interest rates.

The BCC intervened more than 15 times in 2009 and once at end-March 2010. Effective January 1, 2009, in light of information indicating that the BCC had intervened more than three times in the preceding six months, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to floating from free floating. The BCC publishes the daily average exchange rate, which is based on the combined average of the amounts and rates applied in market transactions, as reported by exchange bureaus and banks.

Denmark participates in the ERM II with a central rate of DKr 746.038 per €100. The central rate is a conversion of the central rate vis-à-vis the deutsche mark before the third stage of EMU and was last adjusted in January 1987. Denmark has entered into an agreement with the ECB and the euro area member states on a narrower fluctuation band of ±2.25%. In recent years, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) has consistently maintained a stable krone within less than 1% of the central rate. The DNʹs net purchase or sale of foreign currency during a month is published at 4:00 p.m. on the second working day of the following month in the “Foreign Exchange and Liquidity” press release. The agreement on Denmarkʹs fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro within a narrow fluctuation band of ±2.25% around the central rate in ERM II was concluded at the informal meeting of the Ecofin Council September 25–27, 1998, in Vienna, between the ministers for economy and finance and the central bank governors of the EU member states. While the DN is responsible for monetary policy, exchange rate policy is set by the Danish government in consultation with the DN. Section 2(3) of the Danish Act on Foreign Exchange (Consolidated Act No. 279 of April 11, 1988) states, “Guidelines for the foreign-exchange policy to be conducted while the Act is in force shall be laid down after negotiation between Danmarks Nationalbank and the Royal Bank Commissioner.” The Royal Bank commissioner is the formal link between the government and the DN.

According to the Foreign Exchange Law, the denar exchange rate is determined freely on the basis of demand and supply of foreign exchange in the foreign exchange market. However, beginning October 1995, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) implemented a monetary policy strategy of targeting the denar exchange rate against the German mark until 2002 and thereafter against the euro. The implementation of this monetary policy strategy stems from the importance of the exchange rate of the domestic currency for a small open economy as a transparent nominal anchor for credible monetary policy. In that respect, the NBRM participates in the foreign exchange market in order to maintain a stable exchange rate. Thus, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as stabilized. The NBRM publishes data on daily turnover of the foreign exchange market, which also includes information on NBRM intervention. The NBRM publishes its intervention data on a regular basis in the Quarterly Reports and in the Report on the Management of Foreign Reserves.

Effective March 6, 2009, the authorities introduced a multiple-price foreign exchange auction and phased out their direct intervention to influence the price of the lari on the market. Since May 25, 2009, the authorities have intervened only through auctions. Therefore, effective March 6, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement. The official exchange rate for the dollar is determined daily and is used for budget and tax accounting purposes and for all payments between the government and businesses and other legal entities. The official exchange rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of the cross rates for the dollar and other currencies in the international market. (1) The calculation period for the official exchange rate of the lari against the dollar is determined as the period from 4:30 p.m. of the previous business day to 4:30 p.m. of the calculation day within the Bloomberg trade platform (“trade platform”), taking into account all registered trades. The official exchange rate of the lari vis-à-vis the dollar is calculated as the average weighted exchange rate on the interbank market during the calculation period within the trade platform for registered trades. Trades concluded with the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) acting as a counterparty are considered to be interbank trades. (2) The following instances are not considered in the determination of the official exchange rate of the lari vis-à-vis the dollar: (a) Trades concluded at rates that are significantly different from other registered trades: A trade with a significantly different rate is considered to be a rate that is either 2.5% higher or lower than the average weighted exchange rate of all the other registered trades within the calculation period. (b) Opposite trades that are concluded between two counterparties with similar terms and amounts. (3) Trades that have been used in the calculation of the official exchange rate of the lari vis-à-vis the dollar for the previous day may be used in the calculation of the official exchange rate during the calculation period if (a) the number of registered trades within the trade platform during the calculation period that, according to the criteria set out in Paragraph 3, may be used in the calculation of the official exchange rate is less than three; or (b) the total amount of the trades concluded within the trade platform during the calculation period that, according to Paragraph 3, may be used in the calculation of the official exchange rate is less than 3 million. (4) The official exchange rate of the lari vis-à-vis other foreign currencies is determined according to the rate in international markets or the issuer countryʹs domestic interbank currency market on the basis of cross-currency exchange rates. (5) The list of the particular market segment for the foreign currencies (either interbank or CB rate) to be used in the determination of the cross-currency exchange rate is determined by the NBG. (6) The sources to be used for the acquisition of exchange rates are the Reuters and Bloomberg Information systems and CBsʹ corresponding websites. (7) In the determination of cross-currency exchange rates, the latest available exchange rates are used. (8) Cross-currency exchange rates, the rates of foreign currencies (other than the lari) vis-à-vis the dollar, are determined by the CB each business day from 2:45 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. In case of technical difficulties, a delay in the determination of exchange rates is allowed until the technical problems have been resolved. The central bank has taken preliminary steps toward inflation targeting and is preparing for transition to full-fledged inflation targeting. The NBG announced a medium-term inflation target for 2010–12 of 6% a year."
2009,134,Germany,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating.

The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. The ECB publishes a reference rate based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates. To maintain price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem and of the single monetary policy for which it is responsible. This is stated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 127(1). “Without prejudice to the objective of price stability,” the Eurosystem will also “support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community.” These include a “high level of employment” and “sustainable and non-inflationary growth.”"

The exchange rate of the cedi is determined in the market by both interbank foreign exchange activity and foreign exchange bureaus. Ghana joined the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the cedi and the dollar be maintained within a margin of ±15% around the central rate. However, the authorities have yet to implement these measures. The Bank of Ghana (BOG) does not publish information on its interventions. The weighted transaction exchange rate of the banking sector is based on the daily volume of trades and the actual rates reported by ADs in their dealings with each other and with their customers during the previous day. The BOG official exchange rate is derived from the banking industryʹs weighted transaction exchange rates which are used in all official transactions, including government foreign exchange transactions with the CB and state-owned enterprises. The monetary policy framework is inflation targeting."

2009,258,Guatemala,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. In accordance with Monetary Board Resolution JM-145-2009, Guatemala has a flexible exchange rate arrangement in which the exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market by the supply of and demand for foreign exchange; however, the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the nominal exchange rate, without affecting its path. The BOGʹs intervention in the exchange market is based on a specific, transparent, and comprehensible rule, which limits daily volatility. During 2009, the BOG intervened on 16 occasions. In light of the intervention rule, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been classified as floating. Intervention data are publicly available on the BOGʹs website. Because there is no commitment to a certain level or trajectory of the nominal exchange rate, the BOG has monetary autonomy to ensure the fundamental objective of achieving low and stable inflation. The BOGʹs mission is to maintain price stability. The annual inflation target is announced as a central target plus a margin and is currently set at 5% ±1% for 2010 and 2011 (previously, 5.5% ±1% for 2009). The BOG calculates and publishes the reference exchange rate (i.e., target conversion rate, TCR), which is equal to the weighted average of the exchange rates corresponding to all the foreign exchange buying and selling operations engaged in by the institutions making up the institutional foreign exchange market (IFEM). The TCR is applicable to, among other things, the settlement of tax and other obligations entailing payments from or to the government and its entities and the resolution of administrative and/or legal disputes."
2009,656,Guinea,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Guinea announced its participation in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which formally limits the fluctuation of the franc to ±15% around a central rate vis-à-vis the dollar. This has yet to be implemented, however. Given the frequent changes in the foreign exchange operational framework, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed from floating, effective June 1, 2009. Effective September 14, 2009, the government announced an administratively determined exchange rate, with weekly publication of the exchange rate. In view of its adverse impact on the economy in general and the large spread between the parallel foreign exchange market and the official rate, this administrative decision was rescinded effective November 17, 2009. This enabled the CBRG to resume its use of the floating exchange rate mechanism. The CBRG publishes a daily reference exchange rate for the franc vis-à-vis the most important foreign currencies for the country on the basis of dollar-franc exchange transactions between banks and their customers. These rates are determined by supply and demand in the foreign currency market. The CB calculates the average dollar-franc rate charged by banks, weighted by the volume of transactions. The rates of other currencies are calculated on the basis of their previous dayʹs rate vis-à-vis the SDR, as published by the IMF. However, to avoid excessive daily fluctuations because of a thin market, daily fluctuations of the reference rate are capped at ±0.5%. The reference rate is used only for accounting purposes. The CBRG regularly publishes information regarding foreign exchange market interventions. The monetary policy, for its part, aims to control monetary aggregates."

The CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the fixed rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro for the currency concerned. The monetary cooperation agreement between the WAEMU member countries and France was signed December 4, 1973. The Conference of Heads of State and Government may decide to amend the monetary cooperation agreement between the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) member countries and France. The monetary cooperation agreement between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of CFA francs into euros, the WAEMU member countries are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."

The Bank of Guyana (BOG) periodically purchases foreign currency from cambio dealers in order to maintain international reserves at acceptable levels. In accordance with bilateral agreements with the CARICOM CBs, the BOG quotes weekly rates for certain CARICOM currencies. Reflecting the stability of the Guyana dollar against the U.S. dollar as a result of interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2009,263,Haiti,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Due to the gourdeʹs stability against the dollar in a 2% depreciating trend, the de facto exchange rate classification was reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement from floating, effective April 1, 2008, through January 10, 2010. However, because of an initial collapse in demand for foreign currency, followed by foreign exchange inflows after the January 2010 earthquake, the exchange rate appreciated sharply and has remained more volatile. Therefore, effective January 11, 2010, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed arrangement from a crawl-like arrangement. Foreign exchange sales and purchases by the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) are used for smoothing exchange rate fluctuations. The BRH publishes weekly information on foreign exchange interventions on its website. The reference rate is officially used by banks to convert dollar amounts on their books and in their financial statements and other reports into gourdes. The CB does this to prevent banks from using different rates for the same date. As a result, financial and nonfinancial institutions have used this rate within the framework of their exchange transactions. Although base money is an indicative target for monetary policy, the CB looks at exchange rate movements (given the high pass-through of inflation), liquidity conditions, and growth."
2009,268,Honduras,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling band. The exchange rate of the lempira is determined by foreign exchange auctions of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). Since May 8, 2008, the BCH has maintained an operational band requiring all bid prices for the purchase of foreign exchange to be within a range of 7% above or below the base price established, with such prices subject to the requirement that bids for subsequent auctions not exceed 0.075% of the average reference rate derived from auctions concluded within the seven preceding business days. Because the authorities maintained a policy of meeting all admissible bids within the ±7% band around the base price, the exchange rate was effectively pegged vis-à-vis the dollar at the ceiling of the band. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The base price is determined according to a procedure established by the BCH board of directors for this purpose, which may include the following variables: the differential between the domestic inflation rate and the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners, changes in the exchange rates of these countriesʹ currencies vis-à-vis the dollar, and the performance of official reserve assets. The external inflation rate is considered to be the weighted average of the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners. Domestic inflation is measured by the consumer price index (CPI). The change in the dollar exchange rates of the main trading partners is measured using the effective exchange rate index, which is compiled weekly on the basis of the weighted average of the exchange rates of the main trading partners expressed in units of their respective currencies to $1.00. Finally, an adjustment factor is applied to the base price of the auction, depending on the number of months of imports covered by the BCHʹs reserve assets."
2009,944,Hungary,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. Effective March 1, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from free floating because of the discretionary interventions made by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) in the foreign exchange market. The possible objectives of foreign exchange intervention are listed in the MNBʹs intervention strategy, which has not been published. The strategy aims to avoid disruptive market fluctuation and exchange rate overshooting. However, the strategy emphasizes that the MNB generally refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange market. The MNB converts foreign currency for the government and the net current and capital transfers from the EU on the foreign exchange market. These transactions change the foreign exchange reserve position of the MNB. If the resulting reserve dynamics are not in line with the MNBʹs reserve management objectives, some of the funds are channeled to the market. Typically, this has resulted in foreign currency sales in the past few years. Sales are conducted in small amounts at market prices. The MNB announces the policy of channeling the foreign exchange position resulting from the government-related foreign exchange flows to the market. The net amounts are published quarterly. The MNB has adopted a medium-term target for inflation for the period starting in 2007 and onward, defined as a 3% rate of increase in consumer prices as measured by the consumer price index regularly published by the Central Statistical Office. In some cases the law (e.g., the Accountancy Act or the Rules of the Tax and Financial Auditing Office) requires or allows companies to use the official exchange rate when evaluating assets/liabilities or revenues/expenditures denominated in foreign currency. Official foreign exchange rates of the National Bank of Hungary are fixed on each weekday, except for national public holidays. These published exchange rates are valid until the publication of the next dayʹs rates. The exchange rates are fixed at 11:00 a.m. The official euro-forint fixing rate is the simple arithmetic average of the euro-forint quotes of the 10 most active domestic banks in the forint foreign exchange market, after the two highest and two lowest quotes are eliminated. The dollar-forint fixing rate is calculated using this euro-forint fixing rate and the euro-dollar market rate at 11:00 a.m. The forint exchange rates against other currencies are derived from the dollar-forint fixing and the foreign exchange cross rates at 11:00 a.m."
2009,176,Iceland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is floating with some intervention in the interbank foreign exchange market from the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI). Data on the CBIʹs foreign exchange intervention are published daily on its website. A formal inflation target was adopted on March 27, 2001. The CBIʹs main objective is price stability, defined as a 12-month rise of 2½% in the consumer price index. If it deviates by more than 1½% in either direction, the CBI is obliged to present to the government a report, which is made public, explaining the reasons for the deviation from the target and the CBIʹs response to the deviation. On each trading day at 10:45 a.m., the CBI determines the official exchange rate of the króna against currencies to be used as the exchange rate for official agreements, court cases, and other agreements between parties when an alternative exchange rate is not specified (Article 19 of the Central Bank Act No. 36/2001). The fixing is a snapshot of the position in the foreign exchange market."
2009,534,India,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) periodically intervenes. The rupeeʹs exchange rate is market determined. The RBIʹs role is to modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. In its interventions, the RBI purchases and sells spot and forward dollars in the interbank market at the market exchange rate. The RBI deals only with ADs. The RBI publishes monthly data on its interventions (foreign exchange purchases and sales) in both the spot and the forward market in the RBI Monthly Bulletin. The monetary policy is guided by multiple indicators. The RBI compiles on a daily basis and publishes reference rates for spot dollar-rupees and spot euros-rupees. The rates are arrived at by averaging the mean of the bid and offer rates polled from a few select banks around noon every weekday (excluding Saturdays). The contributing banks are selected on the basis of their standing, market share in the domestic foreign exchange market, and representative character. The RBI periodically reviews the procedure for selecting the banks and the methodology of polling in order to ensure that the reference rate is a true reflection of the market activity."

The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the Bank Indonesia (BI) may intervene in the foreign exchange market to prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. The BI does not disclose data on its interventions. Reflecting developments in the exchange rate following official interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The BI formally adopted an inflation-targeting framework. The government has set the inflation targets for 2009, and 2010 at 4.5%, and 4%, ±1%, respectively, after coordinating with the BI."
2009,433,Iraq,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has allowed the exchange rate to appreciate gradually vis-à-vis the dollar following a predetermined path. Within these limits, the exchange rate of the dinar is determined in the foreign exchange market. Since January 2009, the CBI has set the rate of crawl at zero, stabilizing the exchange rate at about ID 1,170 per dollar; as a result, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement against the dollar from a crawling peg, effective January 1, 2009. The CBI determines the official exchange rate, which is applied to auctions. The official exchange rate is also used for reevaluation purposes in the accounting system. The auction rate of the last day of each month is taken as the reference exchange rate for accounting purposes. The intervention data are published on the CBI website."

2009,512,Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. In the absence of alternative monetary policy instruments, the DAB intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market in the form of twice-weekly selling foreign exchange auctions. The auction results are published on the DAB website. The DAB deals with ADs only through the auction. The primary goal of these auctions is to control the growth of currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction exchange rate volatility. The DAB also has a currency-in-circulation target in the context of an IMF program. Indicative interbank buying and selling rates for nine currencies against the afghani are collected from 10 dealers in the foreign exchange market on a daily basis between 9:30 a.m. and 10:00 a.m. The DABʹs official reference rates are then determined as the average of the market rates for each currency. The official exchange rate is provided as a daily benchmark or reference point for commercial banks, private sector entities, and government agencies to use in their transactions."
2009,429,Islamic Republic of Iran,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed floating arrangement against a basket of currencies. Although the authorities remain in control of the exchange rate, the rialʹs volatility against the dollar, euro, and yen increased in 2008. However, since June 10, 2009, the rial has stabilized within a 2% band against a composite. Therefore, effective June 10, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a stabilized arrangement against a composite from other managed arrangement."
2009,436,Israel,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate policy is based on a free float of the new sheqel vis-à-vis other currencies, and for many years the Bank of Israel (BOI) has pursued a policy of nonintervention in the foreign exchange market. However, the BOI retains the option to intervene through the purchase or sale of foreign currency in the interbank market, should the need arise. Effective August 10, 2009, following the adoption of a new operating policy in the foreign exchange market, the BOI discontinued its program of daily purchases of $100 million in the foreign exchange market. Previously, the BOI implemented a program via daily purchases to boost its foreign reserves to $40–$44 billion (initially the target range was $35–$40 billion). The new program was announced five days in advance on the BOI website. As part of the new policy, the BOI acts in the foreign exchange market in the event of unusual movements in the exchange rate that are inconsistent with underlying economic conditions or when conditions in the foreign exchange market are disorderly. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from free floating, effective August 10, 2009. The BOI publishes its monthly net foreign exchange purchase in a communiqué. The government has set an inflation target as part of its economic policy, and the objective of monetary policy is to reach that target. It does so by determining the level of short-term interest rates on its loans to the banks and deposits from them, and thus, via the financial markets, influences the money supply in the economy. The representative rate of the new sheqel against the dollar for a specific day is the average rate in new sheqels of bilateral interbank quotes during a predetermined sampling period. Values that deviate from the sample average by more than two standard deviations are excluded from the calculation of the representative rate. In exceptional cases, when the calculated exchange rate does not reflect actual rates prevailing in the market, discretion may be exercised in determining the representative rate. The representative rates of the new sheqel against other currencies are based on the representative rate of the dollar and the exchange rates of the relevant currencies against the dollar on the international money markets at the time the representative rate is determined. Therefore, the representative rate of any currency against the new sheqel is an indicator of the exchange rate prevailing in the foreign exchange market, is based on an average of buying and selling prices published by banks, and does not necessarily reflect rates at which transactions were carried out. The rates have no official or legal standing and are not published in the Official Gazette. They are used mainly for valuations and in contracts. Parties to a foreign-currency-indexed business transaction may carry out the transaction at any exchange rate agreed between them. The representative rate is binding for such a transaction only if explicitly stipulated in advance by the parties."

The exchange rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market, where the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) intervenes frequently. As a result of official actions, the Jamaican dollar has been stable against the U.S. dollar since February, 10, 2009. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar from floating, effective February, 10, 2009. The BOJ publishes information on its foreign exchange market interventions in its Annual Report and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report. The stated monetary policy objective is to control base money and inflation. Under the Bank of Jamaica Act (1960), the conduct of monetary policy is aimed at regulating the growth of money and credit in line with the resources expected to finance economic activity and generate employment, without undermining the conditions of price stability.

The NBKʹs interventions through the Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) are for the purpose of implementing monetary policy and are based on advice from the NBK Monetary Policy Technical Committee. The NBK does not publish data on its interventions. On February 4, 2009, the tenge was devalued by 18% and, in accordance with the NBKʹs announcement, a trading band was established vis-à-vis the dollar at ±3%. Therefore, effective February 4, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands from a stabilized arrangement. Because the tenge exhibited much less volatility than the official trading band, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified to a stabilized arrangement against the dollar from a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands, effective May 1, 2009. Beginning October 28, 2009, the tenge followed an appreciating trend against the dollar consistent with a crawl-like arrangement. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a crawl-like from a stabilized arrangement, effective October 28, 2009. On February 1, 2010, the tenge trading band was widened asymmetrically to a range between +10% and –15%. The official exchange rate of the tenge against the dollar is determined on the basis of daily quotes from the domestic currency market (the weighted average rate at 11:00 a.m. the previous day, based on trading results on the KASE). The rates for other currencies are calculated on the basis of quotes against the dollar on the global currency market. The NBK publishes daily exchange rates of certain currencies against the tenge for accounting and customs payment computation purposes."

Official foreign exchange market interventions aim to moderate the rate of change and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than establish a particular level. Data on interventions are only partially disclosed. If the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) uses the auction system to intervene, the market will have knowledge of the amount dealt and the average rate (the average rate is published after the auction closes). If the CBK chooses to intervene directly (i.e., by buying or selling foreign exchange from or to banks directly through the Reuters dealing system), the markets will know the CBK intervened but amounts and rates will not be published. The official exchange rate is set at the previous dayʹs average market rate at closing. The official exchange rate indicates to market participants the level and direction of exchange rate movement. In its implementation of monetary policy, the CBK aims to control monetary aggregates."

Since May 20, 2007, the de jure exchange rate arrangement of the dinar has been a peg against an undisclosed basket of currencies, comprised of Kuwaitʹs major trading and financial partner countries (Decree No. 147/2007), whereby the CBK declares on a daily basis the exchange rate of the dinar against the dollar. Effective January 1, 2009, the de facto classification of the exchange rate arrangement was changed to other managed arrangement from a conventional peg, because the official policy could not be confirmed empirically. However, starting in March 2009, observed exchange rate movements corroborate that the dinar is pegged to a composite once again. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a conventional peg to a composite from other managed arrangement, effective March 1, 2009. The CBK does not publish its intervention data."
2009,917,Kyrgyz Republic,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) participates and intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market to reduce exchange rate volatility as necessary. In line with recent exchange rate movements, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The official exchange rate of the som against the dollar is calculated as the daily weighted average of the exchange rates used in the purchase and sale transactions of dollars conducted in the foreign exchange market through the Trade Information Electronic System (TIES) of the NBKR for the reporting period from 3:00 p.m. of the previous trading day to 3:00 p.m. of the current trading day. The official exchange rates of the other foreign currencies are calculated daily based on the cross-exchange rates of the quotes for these foreign currencies against the dollar on the international foreign exchange market. The official exchange rate is used by tax and customs authorities and legal entities for accounting purposes. The NBKR publishes its daily purchases and sales of foreign exchange on its website. According to the Law on the National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic, the primary objective of the CB is to maintain price stability through the implementation of corresponding monetary policy."
2009,544,Lao Peopleʹs Democratic Republic,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. As a result of the management of the float in the trading band, the kip has been very stable against the dollar since September 2008. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement against the dollar from other managed arrangement, effective September 12, 2008. The Bank of Lao P.D.R. (BOL) does not publish its intervention data. The official exchange rate is calculated by the BOL as the weighted average of the previous dayʹs interbank rates. It is used as a daily reference rate for the purpose of establishing a trading band in the interbank market."
2009,941,Latvia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Law on the Bank of Latvia (BOL) gives the BOL authority to set the official exchange rate of the lats, and since January 1, 2005, the BOL has fixed the rate at LVL 0.702804 per euro and has limited movement of the exchange rate to ±1% relative to this rate. Latvia participates in the ERM II. The BOL fixes the rates of the lats daily against 40 convertible currencies and the price of gold. These rates are used for accounting purposes and are valid through the next day. The BOL publishes its intervention data on a weekly basis."
2009,446,Lebanon,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is free floating. The Banque du Liban (BDL) monitors the official exchange rate as part of its role to maintain sustainable economic growth, a stable inflation rate, stable purchasing power, and accordingly social and economic stability. In practice, the exchange rate remains within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as stabilized. The BDL intervenes in the foreign exchange market daily from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m. Monday through Thursday, and from 10:00 a.m. until noon on Friday. The CB does not publish intervention data."
2009,666,Lesotho,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The loti is pegged to the South African rand at M 1 per R 1, under Article 2 of the Bilateral Monetary Agreement between Lesotho and South Africa. The exchange rate is 1:1, backed by the net international reserves position target of $650–$700 million."
2009,668,Liberia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to counter speculative movements. Since the beginning of 2009, the Liberian dollar has fluctuated more against the U.S. dollar. Previously, it had remained stable. As a result, effective March 1, 2009, the classification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been changed to other managed from a stabilized arrangement. The CBL uses the exchange rate as an indicator of domestic monetary conditions and gears its management of Liberian dollar liquidity to keep the exchange rate relatively stable. There is no official or reference exchange rate in Liberia."
2009,672,Libya,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The dinar is pegged to the SDR at LD 1 per SDR 0.5175. The dollar is the intervention currency.
2009,946,Lithuania,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The litas is pegged to the euro at the rate of LTL 3.4528 per euro within the context of the ERM II. The currency board was established by the Law on Credibility of the Litas and has been in effect since April 1, 1994. The litas exchange rate against the euro at the rate of LTL 3.4528 per euro was fixed by the Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania “on the approbation of the proposal of the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) regarding the anchor currency and the litas official exchange rate” (February 1, 2002, No. 157) and the Resolution of the Bank of Lithuania “on the anchor currency and the official exchange rate of the litas” (February 1, 2002, No. 15). According to the Law on Credibility of the Litas, the BOL covers all its liabilities denominated in litas with its foreign reserves. According to Article 3 of the Law on Credibility of the Litas, the official exchange rate of the litas and the anchor currency is established or changed by the BOL in coordination with the government of Lithuania. The Law on the BOL delegates to the BOL the function of determining the litas exchange rate regulation system in an independent manner. As a member of the ERM II, Lithuania must also adhere to its rules, in particular with respect to consultation with other ERM II partners."
2009,137,Luxembourg,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is independently floating. Luxembourg participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2009, 15 other members of the EU (previously 14; now including the Slovak Republic) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. The ECB publishes a reference rate based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates. This rate is for statistical purposes only. To maintain price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem and of the single monetary policy for which it is responsible. This is stated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 127(1). “Without prejudice to the objective of price stability”, the Eurosystem will also “support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community”. These include a “high level of employment” and “sustainable and non-inflationary growth”. Price stability is defined as an inflation rate below but close to 2%."
2009,674,Madagascar,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the official interbank market. The Central Bank of Madagascar (CBM) intervenes in the interbank market to smooth large exchange rate fluctuations and meet foreign reserve targets. Information on CBM daily interventions is not publicly available. Only the weighted average daily rate as well as the number and the amount of transactions are made available to the public through the CBM official site. The official exchange rate is computed daily as the weighted average daily rate in the interbank market and is used for government transactions. This rate is also used for customs valuation but not on an instantaneous basis (in practice, customs duties paid by importers are set using an average of the previous weekʹs interbank exchange rates). The monetary policy aims to control monetary aggregates."
2009,676,Malawi,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Official intervention focuses on meeting the target on the net foreign reserves position and limiting exchange rate volatility and takes into account seasonal fluctuations. The exchange rate has experienced little volatility vis-à-vis the dollar against the backdrop of tight management and direct and indirect interventions of the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM). However, in December 2009, Malawi officially adopted a floating exchange rate, and the kwacha has gradually depreciated since then. Thus, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement effective December 2, 2009. The monetary policy of the RBM aims to control monetary aggregates. The official exchange rate is used in official transactions. The exchange rate is determined by the RBM, which is the dominant player in the interbank market for foreign exchange. By intermediating demand and supply, it influences the movement of the exchange rate through the use of moral suasion."
2009,548,Malaysia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) operates a de jure managed float for the ringgit with reference to a currency basket. The composition of the basket is not disclosed. The monetary policy has various nominal anchors. As a result of the ringgit tracking a composite, although not closely enough to be classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to other managed arrangement from floating, effective January 1, 2009. The CB does not publish its intervention data."
2009,556,Maldives,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rufiyaa is pegged to the dollar at a buying rate of Rf 12.75 per dollar and a selling rate of Rf 12.85 per dollar. The president, according to the MMA Act, can decide on a change in the exchange rate arrangement or adjust the exchange rate."
2009,678,Mali,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. Mali participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The CFA franc is officially pegged to the euro, the intervention currency, at the rate of CFAF 655.957 per euro. Exchange rates for other currencies are derived from the rate for the currency concerned in the Paris foreign exchange market vis-à-vis the euro. The monetary cooperation agreement between the WAEMU member countries and France was signed December 4, 1973. The Conference of Heads of State and Government may decide to amend the monetary cooperation agreement between the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) member countries and France. The monetary cooperation agreement established between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU member countries are required to deposit 50.0% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2009,181,Malta,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Malta adopted the euro on January 1, 2008. Effective January 1, 2009, it participates in the EUʹs EMU with 15 other EU member states (previously 14; now 15, including the Slovak Republic) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes reference exchange rates based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. and is usually updated by 3 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates and is published for reference purposes only.

2009,867,Marshall Islands,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange.
2009,682,Mauritania,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The ouguiya was previously de facto pegged to the dollar, at an exchange rate of UM 268.6 per dollar. The new foreign exchange market operates in the framework of a fixing session in which the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) intervenes. The BCM intervenes in the exchange market for regulatory purposes, based on exchange rate policy objectives (smoothing the exchange rate) and the projected level of official exchange reserves. The monetary framework pursues multiple targets. The official or reference exchange rate is used by the BCM, primary banks, and exchange bureaus to set the buying and selling rates offered to their customers while distinguishing account operations from manual exchange operations. They are also used by customs units and other economic operators for contractual, accounting, or statistical purposes. The following method is used to determine the official or reference exchange rate: for the dollar (central rate)—the fixing rate of the previous day; for other currencies—the dollar fixing rate and the quotes of these currencies against the dollar on the international market. A summary statement of BCM intervention data is updated daily on the BCM website."
2009,684,Mauritius,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Intervention by the Central Bank of Mauritius (CBM) is limited to smoothing operations and does not aim to offset market forces. Information regarding interventions is published regularly on the CBM website and in its publications. The CBM did not intervene in the foreign exchange market from December 2008 through March 2010. As a result, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. The CBM pursues multiple indicators of monetary policy. The official exchange rate (which is referred to as the Central Rate by the CBM) is used only for the valuation and recording of the assets and liabilities of the CBM. A three-day moving weighted average rate used in transactions, for deals above $30,000 as supplied by commercial banks, determines the official exchange rate."
2009,273,Mexico,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the peso is determined in the foreign exchange market. Effective February 4, 2009, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) started a series of six discretionary interventions through direct sales to individual participants in the market for an aggregate amount of US$1.835 billion to fend off intense speculative activity. Since April 2009, the BOM has refrained from discretionary intervention in the foreign exchange market as market conditions normalized. However, the BOM maintained its intervention mechanism based on auctions with minimum prices, which triggered eight interventions from April 2009 to April 2010. The BOM introduced a new intervention mechanism based on put auctions, which trigger the right of the buyer to sell dollars when the exchange rate appreciates higher than its 20-day moving average, with BOM foreign exchange purchases still subject to the discretion of the option holder – which may choose to wait further before exercising the option. The BOM sold put option three times at the end of each month from February 2010 to April 2010, and, as a result, the BOM bought foreign exchange from banks nine times during the same period. The BOM reserves the right to make extraordinary sales of foreign exchange in case it is required due to market conditions. The exchange rate (FIX) is determined by the BOM as an average of quotes in the wholesale foreign exchange market for operations payable on the second following banking day. The BOM determines the FIX at noon on each banking day, after receiving all the quotes and making the respective calculation. The FIX is published in the Official Gazette (Diario Oficial de la Federación) one banking day after its determination date and is used to settle liabilities denominated in dollars payable in Mexico on the following day. The FIX serves only as a reference; its use in foreign exchange transactions by market participants is not mandatory. In pursuing monetary policy, the BOM aims to influence interest rates and inflation expectations in order to make price behavior consistent with the objective of maintaining an environment of low and stable inflation."
2009,921,Moldova,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Moldova (NBM) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the leu against the dollar. Sharp exchange rate fluctuations are not specifically defined; however, the NBM intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market depending on the market conditions and future expectations of market participants. At the same time, the NBM interventions are not aimed at changing the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM publishes aggregated monthly data regarding its interventions and the interbank market turnover on its website. The data show interventions by currency and type of operation (spot or derivatives). The official exchange rate of the leu against the dollar is determined daily as the weighted average of the exchange rates applied for noncash transactions, performed on the interbank and intrabank market. The official exchange rate is used for accounting and statistical purposes. The monetary policy aims to maintain price stability by controlling monetary aggregates."
2009,948,Mongolia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Bank of Mongolia (BOM) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market using the dollar as the principal intervention currency. Against the backdrop of a rapid devaluation of the togrog between October 2008 and February 2009, the exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, as of November 1, 2008. On March 24, 2009, the BOM instituted a foreign exchange auction allowing the determination of the exchange rate mainly by market forces. Therefore, effective March 24, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from other managed arrangement. The BOM intervenes through the auction to reach its foreign reserves target and to limit day-to-day exchange rate volatility. The BOM publishes the intervention data on its website. The BOMʹs reference rate is the midpoint of exchange rates used in the accounting, customs valuation, and government transactions with the CB. The reference rate is announced each weekday except for national holidays. This reference rate is valid until the next announcement of the new exchange rate by the BOM. Previously, the official (reference) exchange rate of the togrog vis-à-vis the dollar was announced daily by the BOM as the daily average of the buying and selling rates of transactions among participants in the interbank foreign exchange market. Exchange rates for other convertible currencies are calculated on the basis of the cross rates vis-à-vis the dollar in international markets. The BOM pursues M2 as an intermediate target and reserve money as an operational target in the context of an IMF-supported program."
2009,686,Morocco,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The dirham has been pegged since 1973 to a basket of currencies weighted in accordance with the geographic distribution of Moroccoʹs foreign trade. The composition of this basket is subject to adjustment. Since April 2001, the basket has been composed of the euro and the dollar, with weights of 80% and 20%, respectively. Several price adjustments may be made during the day, based on the trend of foreign currencies on the international foreign exchange market. There is a fixing session that takes place at 2:00 p.m., which also includes the currencies of the Arab Maghreb Union countries. The Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) publishes its monthly foreign exchange purchases and sales on its website."
2009,688,Mozambique,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. As a major conduit for aid flows, the Bank of Mozambique (BM) is the main channel for foreign exchange into the market. It also intervenes to smooth seasonal fluctuations and for sterilization purposes. The BM announces the average foreign exchange buying and selling rates of commercial banks in the interbank foreign exchange market (MCI— monetary conditions index), which the banks record online using software provided by the BM. The exchange rate is calculated as the average of the exchange rates quoted by commercial banks as determined at 3:30 p.m. based on the exchange rates quoted that day. The rates determined at 3:30 p.m. are not used by the BM in its foreign exchange buying and selling transactions on the calculation date (the market closes at 3:30 p.m.) or on the following day. In its foreign exchange buying and selling transactions in the MCI (including auction sales), the BM uses the same-day quotes shown on the screen for each bank, throughout the MCI business hours, based on the best price criterion (highest sale price and lowest purchase price). Data on the BM intervention in the MCI are posted on the BM website on a biweekly basis. The monetary policy of the BM aims at controlling monetary aggregates."
2009,518,Myanmar,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The kyat is officially pegged to the SDR at K 8.50847 per SDR within a margin of ±2%. The exchange rates of the kyat for the euro, Indian rupee, yen, Pakistani rupee, pound sterling, Singapore dollar, Sri Lanka rupee, Swiss franc, and U.S. dollar are determined by daily calculations on the basis of the value of these currencies against the SDR issued by the IMF. The exchange rates for other currencies are determined on the basis of the daily foreign exchange rates in the Singapore market. The monetary policy targets multiple indicators."
2009,728,Namibia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Namibia dollar is pegged to the South African rand at par. The exchange rate of the Namibia dollar vis-à-vis other currencies is determined on the basis of cross rates in international markets of the South African rand vis-à-vis the currencies concerned.
2009,558,Nepal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Nepalese rupee has been pegged to the Indian rupee at the rate of Nr 1.6 per rupee since February 1993. The reference rate of the dollar quoted by the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) is based on the average of the quoted buying and selling rates of commercial banks. Buying and selling rates are quoted daily for certain other currencies, with quotes based on the buying and selling rates for the dollar in markets abroad. The official exchange rate fixed by the NRB is used for NRB and government transactions. Nepal Rastra Bank Act No. 2058 (2002) authorizes the NRB to establish Nepalʹs exchange rate arrangement. Only the NRB can decide on a change in the exchange rate arrangement. The NRB publishes its intervention data regularly."

The guilder is pegged to the dollar, the intervention currency, at NA f. 1.7900 per dollar. The official selling rate is NA f. 1.82 per dollar. This rate includes the 1% license fee on the purchase of foreign exchange. Official buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are set daily on the basis of rates of the dollar abroad. The current peg was established in a National Decree of December 24, 1971. The Council of Ministers can decide on a change in the exchange rate arrangement."
2009,196,New Zealand,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may intervene if the exchange rate is exceptionally high or low, if that rate is not justified by economic fundamentals, and if there is a material prospect that the intervention will influence the exchange rate. Interventions may not be used as an attempt to influence the long-term trend of the exchange rate. As a result, RBNZ interventions are very rare. The RBNZ publishes information on its international reserves and foreign exchange swap position on its website but does not publish data on its direct intervention. The RBNZ has not intervened with the purpose of influencing the New Zealand dollar in the foreign exchange market since June 2007. The Reserve Bank Act requires that price stability be defined in a specific and public contract, the Policy Targets Agreement (PTA), negotiated between the government and the RBNZ. The current PTA, signed in December 2009, defines price stability as annual increases in the consumer price index (CPI) of between 1% and 3% on average over the medium term. This implies that monetary policy targets CPI inflation and not the exchange rate. The RBNZ publishes a reference exchange rate for statistical purposes, sourced from a survey of broker and market quotes."

2009,694,Nigeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The CBN explicitly aims to maintain an exchange rate principally driven by market forces but intervenes to reduce volatility and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. The de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified from a stabilized arrangement to other managed arrangement, effective January 1, 2009, because of the increased volatility of the naira at the end of 2008 and the frequent changes in policy over the past two years. Effective February 9, 2009, the CBN announced a ±3% band for the naira around the official rate recorded on that date (N 145.85 to $1), and the buying and selling rates of ADs and the exchange bureaus that buy foreign exchange from the CBN were limited to ±1% and ±2% around the CBN rates, respectively. Subsequently, effective May 22, 2009, limits on the buying and selling rates of ADs have been eliminated. The CBN publishes information on its interventions through auction on its website; however, data on interventions in the interbank market are not disseminated. Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the naira and the dollar be maintained within ±15% around the central rate. The CBN has not implemented this regime. The monetary policy aims to control monetary aggregates."
2009,142,Norway,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the krone floats freely and independently against other currencies. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Norges Bank (NB) does not normally intervene to influence the exchange rate of the krone; however, it may intervene in the foreign exchange market on short notice if the krone deviates substantially from the level that the NB considers reasonable in relation to fundamentals and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target. The NB may also intervene in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level. The NB has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999. Foreign exchange purchases for the government pension fund are publicly preannounced on the CB website. The monetary policy framework is inflation targeting. The NBʹs monetary policy is oriented toward low and stable inflation. The operational target is annual consumer price inflation of close to 2.5% over time. The NBʹs exchange rates are middle rates (i.e., the midpoint between buying and selling rates in the interbank market at a given time). Rates are usually determined at 2:15 p.m. local time. The NB publishes the rates on electronic information systems as soon as the calculations have been completed. The exchange rates are intended to serve only as an indication and are not binding on the NB or other banks, but they are often used as a reference and for historical comparisons."

2009,288,Paraguay,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; the exchange rate of the guaraní is determined by supply and demand. The Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) intervenes in the exchange market to smooth the effects of undue fluctuations. The objective of the CBP under Article 3 of its Organic Law (No. 489/95) is to preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Moreover, Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the CBP aims to smooth seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. Article 47 establishes that the exchange rate is determined by market forces. The CBP publishes information on its foreign exchange interventions. The CBP computes the official reference exchange rate by taking the average of rates used in major foreign exchange transactions in the market. The rate is usually announced three times a day: at 9:30 a.m., 11:00 a.m., and 1:00 p.m. The reference exchange rate ensures a transparent foreign currency market and information of market participants. Officially, the CBP prepares at the beginning of the year a monetary program, including targets for main monetary aggregates. In practice, the CBP has followed multiple monetary policy objectives—exchange rate, inflation, and quantitative monetary targets—shifting from one to another in an ad hoc way but always with the aim of maintaining a relatively stable exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to other managed arrangement from floating, effective January 1, 2009."
2009,924,Peopleʹs Republic of China,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"""China officially maintains a de jure managed floating exchange rate arrangement based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. The renminbi has been stabilized within a range of ±1% since mid-2008. The daily U.S. dollar–renminbi trading price on the interbank spot foreign exchange market floats within a 0.5% range above and below the middle trading price for U.S. dollars announced by the China Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS). The trading prices for the renminbi against the euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling float within a 3% range above and below the middle trading prices for non-U.S.-dollar currency transactions announced by the CFETS. The CFETS is authorized to announce the daily middle exchange rates for the renminbi against the U.S. dollar, euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling at 9:15 a.m. each working day to serve as the dayʹs middle rates for the interbank spot foreign exchange market (including the over-the-counter (OTC) method and the matching method) as well as the middle prices for exchange rates in bank counter transactions. The method for determining the renminbi–U.S. dollar middle rate is as follows: the CFETS, before the daily interbank foreign exchange market opening quote, asks for quotes from all market makers in the interbank foreign exchange market and uses the market makersʹ quoted prices as the calculation sample for the renminbi–U.S. dollar exchange rate middle rate. After eliminating the highest and lowest quotes, it takes the weighted average of the remaining market makersʹ quotes and obtains the daily renminbi–U.S. dollar foreign exchange middle rate. The weighting is determined by indicators including the transaction volume of the quoting parties in the interbank foreign exchange market and the circumstances of the quotations. The middle rates for renminbi against the euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling, respectively, are determined by the CFETS based on the dayʹs foreign exchange middle rate for renminbi against the U.S. dollar and the exchange rates for the U.S. dollar against the euro, yen, Hong Kong dollar, and pound sterling on international foreign exchange markets at 9:00 a.m. The Peopleʹs Bank of China (PBC) does not publish its intervention data. The Peopleʹs Bank of China Announcement on Expanding the Floating Band of Trading Prices of the renminbi against the U.S. dollar in the Interbank Spot Foreign Exchange Market stipulates that the “daily trading price of the U.S. dollar against the Renminbi on the interbank foreign exchange market floats within a 0.5% range above and below the middle rate for U.S. dollar trading published by the Peopleʹs Bank of China.” Therefore, the officially published middle rate has a guiding effect on market exchange rates."
2009,532,Peopleʹs Republic of China—Hong Kong SAR,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires the monetary base to be backed by the reserve currency (U.S. dollar) around an exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75–HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—has been used since May 18, 2005. The monetary base includes the notes and coins issued, the balance held with the HKMA of banksʹ clearing accounts (i.e., the aggregate balance), and the outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Consistent with currency board principles, the HKMA may issue additional Exchange Fund paper when there is an inflow of funds, and the size of the program is allowed to expand along with the interest payments on such paper. Issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which provide backing for banknotes issued by banks, must be made against U.S. dollars at the fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. Issuance and withdrawal of government-issued notes and coins are settled against U.S. dollars at the same fixed rate. The legal documents that establish the currency board include The Basic Law (Chapter V, Section 1, Articles 110 and 111); Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66); and the Exchange of Letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong SAR under the Exchange Fund Ordinance. In the Exchange of Letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority, it was specified that the Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong SAR, including the linked exchange rate. Section 3(1) of the Ordinance as amended specifies that the Exchange Fund “shall be under the control of the Financial Secretary and shall be used primarily for such purposes as the Financial Secretary thinks fit affecting, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong SAR and for other purposes incidental thereto.” On the other hand, the HKMA is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instrument, and operational means for doing so, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong SAR. The HKMA makes immediate announcements of the impact on the Aggregate Balance due to purchases or sales of U.S. dollars by the Currency Board via various information vendors, including Reuters and Bloomberg. The information is also available on the HKMA website."
2009,293,Peru,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the nuevo sol is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru (CRBP) is authorized by law to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The stated goal of these interventions is to limit foreign exchange volatility without altering the exchange rateʹs primary trend. Intervention may also be conducted using bonds indexed to the exchange rate and repos. The CRBP publishes information regarding its interventions (prices and amounts) on its website. The official exchange rate corresponds to the average interbank exchange rate used in the operations performed through the market real-time system DATATEC. Exchange rates of currencies other than the dollar are determined on the basis of their cross rates with the dollar. The monetary framework is inflation targeting. The CRBP has a continuous inflation target of 2% with a tolerance band between 1% and 3%.
2009,566,Philippines,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) adheres to a market-determined exchange rate policy with some scope for occasional action solely to prevent sharp fluctuations that could be disruptive. This means that the BSP does not target or support a given level of exchange rate; instead, it allows the value of the peso to be determined by the supply and demand of foreign exchange. The BSP does not disclose intervention data, which are for internal use only. However, data on currency swaps settled in foreign currency and nondeliverable forwards settled in domestic currency are reported monthly in Sections II and IV, respectively, of the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which is posted on the BSP website on a monthly basis. The BSP publishes, on a daily basis, reference exchange rates based on Reuters Trading for Foreign Exchange (RTFE) New York closing price for the previous day. These are used for determining the value of a foreign nationʹs currency vis-à-vis the dollar and the peso. The primary objective of the BSPʹs monetary policy is “to promote price stability conducive to a balanced and sustainable growth of the economy.” The adoption of the inflation-targeting framework of monetary policy in January 2002 was aimed at this objective. The governmentʹs inflation target is defined in terms of the average year-over-year change in the consumer price index. The inflation targets have been set at 3.5% with a tolerance interval of ±1% for 2009 and 4.5% with a tolerance interval of ±1% for 2010."
2009,964,Poland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the zloty is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, and the zloty is traded freely against all currencies. The National Bank of Poland (NBP), however, reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market should such intervention be necessary to ensure domestic macroeconomic and financial stability, which is conducive to meeting the inflation target in the medium term. The NBP has intervened once during the past 10 years, on April 8, 2010, and the intervention was followed by a communiqué from the NBP. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. Monetary policy is based on a direct inflation-targeting strategy. Within the framework of this strategy, the Monetary Policy Council defines the inflation target and then adjusts the NBP basic interest rates in order to maximize the probability of achieving the target. The NBP has pursued a continuous inflation target at the level of 2.5% with a permissible fluctuation band of ±1%.

2009,182,Portugal,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is independently floating. Portugal participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2009, 15 other members of the EU (previously 14; now including the Slovak Republic) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. The ECB publishes a reference rate based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates. The exchange rates against the euro published by the ECB are released for reference purposes only. To maintain price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem and of the single monetary policy for which it is responsible. This is stated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the EU, Article 127(1). “Without prejudice to the objective of price stability,” the Eurosystem will also “support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community.” These include a “high level of employment” and “sustainable and non-inflationary growth.” Price stability is defined as an inflation rate below but close to 2%."

Following the transition in March 2008 to a euro-dollar basket peg, the CBA first increased and then reduced the weight of the euro, resulting in a de facto peg against the dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The CBA determines and announces the official exchange rate on a daily basis. The official exchange rate is used for accounting purposes. The CBA publishes its foreign exchange intervention data in its quarterly reports."
2009,634,Republic of Congo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The Republic of Congo participates in the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) and has no separate legal tender.

Exchange transactions in euros between the BEAC and commercial banks are made at this rate. Buying and selling rates for certain other foreign currencies are also listed officially based on the fixed rate for the euro and the rates for these foreign currencies prevailing on the Paris foreign exchange market. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CAEMC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. The exchange rate is fixed by Article 12 of the MCA of November 23, 1972, between the BEAC and France, which states that the par value can be modified following consultation among the signatory states (BEAC members and France), taking into account the demands of the economic and financial situation of the member states. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory states (“Joint Monetary Committee”) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to renounce the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of any member state from the BEAC automatically results in that member stateʹs renunciation of the MCA."
2009,542,Republic of Korea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the won is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. As such, the system is managed in accordance with the principles defined by the free floating system, and the governmentʹs role is very limited, being within the range allowed by the free floating system. However, because of the lack of information on the authoritiesʹ intervention, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from free floating, effective May 1, 2009. The Bank of Korea (BOK) may intervene in the market with the funds of the BOK and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund when it is deemed necessary for the stability of the market. Interventions in the spot market or through derivatives in the forward market are not announced, and intervention data are not published. The inflation target for 2010 onward is 3%, with a tolerance range of ±1% around the target, based on the year-over-year change in the consumer price index. The BOK reviews the performance of inflation targeting annually and makes a public announcement of the results. The target horizon is three years (currently, 2010–12)."

2009,474,Republic of Yemen,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been free floating since July 1996. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) receives most of the foreign exchange proceeds of the country, particularly crude oil export revenues, official loans, and official development assistance. Faced with falling reserves, on June 1, 2009, the CBY reverted from an open window on foreign exchange sales (at a steady rate of about Yrls 200 per dollar) to periodic auctions, which allowed some depreciation of the rial. Therefore, effective July 1, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement. Previously, the rial remained remarkably stable against the dollar within a 2% band. Thus, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a stabilized arrangement. The official exchange rate is determined as an average of exchange rates for the dollar against the rial received in the morning of each working day from a number of banks and money changers. Cross rates for the other currencies are then derived from Reuters. The official exchange rate is used for current account transactions."
2009,968,Romania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) may intervene to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations. There is no formal definition of excessive exchange rate fluctuations: intervention decisions are based on an assessment of domestic and international market circumstances and on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The NBR quotes rates for 28 foreign currencies and the SDR. The exchange rates are based on the quotes of 10 local banks licensed to perform foreign exchange transactions. These banks are selected by the NBR, taking into consideration their participation on the interbank foreign exchange market. The use of exchange rates listed by the NBR is not compulsory for foreign exchange transactions and accounting records. The NBR does not publish information on its interventions. The monetary framework is inflation targeting, and the NBR has an inflation target fixed at 3.5% for end-2010 and end-2011 with a ±1% band."
2009,922,Russian Federation,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement—namely, a controlled floating exchange rate arrangement. The ruble value of a bi-currency basket is used as the operating benchmark for transactions on the internal currency exchange. The bi-currency basket, comprising the dollar and the euro, has been used by the Bank of Russia (BR) as an operating benchmark for currency interventions since 2005. Initially, the composition of the bi-currency basket was €0.10 and $0.90, but as the participants of the internal exchange market adapted to work under the new conditions, the BR revised its composition, increasing the euro share. The basket now is composed of €0.45 and $0.55. The target boundaries of its permissible fluctuations were revised based on changes in fundamental factors governing formation of the countryʹs balance of payments in accordance with the Uniform State Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2008, in response to a gradual transition to a more flexible exchange-rate-setting policy. Between January 11, 2009, and January 23, 2009, the band of permissible fluctuation in the market value of the bi-currency basket grew to 28.85% from 17.88% relative to the central exchange rate of the band. Previously, between January 1, 2008, and December 31, 2008, it grew to 16.9% from 0.59%. On January 23, 2009, the BR announced that the upper boundary of permissible fluctuation in the market value of the bi-currency basket would be set at Rub 41 and the lower boundary at Rub 26. The actual value of the bi-currency basket is determined within this band under the influence of both market factors and exchange interventions by the BR. The permissible fluctuations may be revised in response to changes in macroeconomic indicators. As a result of these policy changes and the continued control of the BR over the exchange rate determination, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The BR intervenes both on interbank currency exchanges and on the over-the-counter (OTC) interbank market to limit daily fluctuations. The official exchange rates of foreign currencies against the ruble are set by the BR for calculating state budget revenues and expenditures; payments and settlements of state administration bodies with enterprises, organizations, and individuals; and taxation and accounting. The official exchange rate for each currency applies until the next official exchange rate becomes effective unless established otherwise by the BR. These rates are based on ruble quotes against the dollar in the internal exchange market and on quotes of other foreign currencies against the dollar in the global exchange market. Since August 2008, the BR has published its volume of interventions on a monthly basis. These data are presented within seven business days of the end of reporting period."
2009,714,Rwanda,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Rwanda (NBR) sells francs at a predetermined reference price to market participants and the government. Effective January 16, 2009, the NBRʹs average reference rate is calculated as a 10-day weighted average of commercial bank rates and the NBRʹs rate for the previous dayʹs operations, to which a fixed margin of ±0.6% is applied to derive the selling and buying rates. Previously, the reference rate was calculated as the weighted mean of five-day moving averages. The rate is determined every morning. The formula used for determining the exchange rate ensured a gradual appreciation of the exchange rate until July 2008, at which point the direction of the exchange rate path reversed, with the pace of depreciation accelerating in January 2009. Since January 2009, the Rwanda franc has been stable against the dollar. Consequently, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective January 1, 2009.The NBR also pursues a monetary aggregate target."
2009,862,Samoa,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The exchange rate is officially determined on the basis of a fixed relationship with a weighted basket of currencies of Samoaʹs main trading partners which comprises the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and euro. Effective March 30, 2009, the methodology for calculation of the weights in the currency basket has been modified. The calculation of weights is now based on trade flows and tourism income flows; previously, it also included private remittances. The central rate is calculated on a daily basis, and therefore it fluctuates according to the levels of the currencies in the basket each day. With the approval of the Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) Board of Directors, the CBS is permitted to make exchange rate adjustments within a margin of ±2% if/when warranted. The CBS does not publish data on its interventions. Currently, there is no existing legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement, except the CBS Act of 1984, which only states that the CBS is the institution responsible for setting the exchange rate. Only the CBS decides (with the approval of its board of directors) on a change in the exchange rate arrangement, provided there is a need to do so and after extensive study justifies such a change."

2009,716,São Tomé and Príncipe,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The official buying exchange rate is determined on a daily basis weighted 40% by the average rate of commercial banks and 60% by the Banco Central de São Tomé e Príncipeʹs (BCSTPʹs) rate on the previous auction day and applied on direct sales by the BCSTP to commercial banks. Rates for certain other currencies are determined on the basis of cross rates between the dollar and the currencies concerned in international markets. Beginning February 1, 2009, the focus of the BCSTP switched from the dollar to the euro, which became the new reference currency. The CB scaled down its intervention on the foreign exchange market to build up reserves before the planned adoption of a formal peg to the euro in 2010. As a result of the reduced BCSTP intervention, the dobra became more volatile against the euro and the dollar starting in April 2009. Consequently, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective April 1, 2009. The period of transition ended in January 2010 with the formal introduction of a peg to the euro. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a conventional peg to the euro from other managed arrangement, effective January 1, 2010."

The Conference of Heads of State and Government may decide to amend the monetary cooperation agreement between the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) member countries and France. The monetary cooperation agreement established between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU member states are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2009,942,Serbia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. According to the 2010 Monetary Policy Program the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) implements a managed floating exchange rate regime. In accordance with the Memorandum of the NBS on Inflation Targeting as Monetary Strategy, foreign exchange intervention is an infrequent, secondary instrument used to support the achievement of the inflation target only after the potential for influencing inflation effectively through changing the key policy rate is exhausted. Interventions in the foreign exchange market take place only to smooth excessive daily fluctuations in the exchange rate for the dinar, in either direction (appreciation or depreciation), contain threats to financial and price stability, and safeguard an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves. Previously, the NBS strove to adjust its foreign exchange regime toward a soft managed float in order to pave the way for the free-floating regime, fully compatible with inflation targeting. In accordance with its commitment, the NBS strives to reduce its participation in the foreign exchange market. In the last quarter of 2008 and in the first two months of 2009, the NBS was forced to intervene in order to slow the depreciation of the dinar in exceptional circumstances and unstable foreign exchange market conditions caused by the spillover of the international financial crisis. Instability in global financial markets resulted in a sudden decrease in the level of household savings and a significant reduction in the portfolio of securities with the NBS, which created increased demand for foreign currency and strong depreciation pressure despite a high key policy rate. The NBS did not intervene in the interbank foreign exchange market between late February and early December 2009 and has not tried to influence the exchange rate through official action de facto following a free float. However, on December 4, 2009, the NBS intervened in the interbank foreign exchange market for the first time in nine months in order to ease excessive daily depreciation of the dinar against the euro and to contribute to the stabilization of the foreign exchange market. The NBS organized an auction to sell €42 million at a fixed price of 96.2 dinar per euro, which decreased excessive daily depreciation of the dinar against the euro. The move was to confront rising demand for foreign exchange toward the end of the year when many firms traditionally repay loans as well as when companies, major importers of energy, buy high amounts of foreign exchange for import payments. The NBS intervened once more in 2009, by selling €58.5 million on December 30. During the first two months of 2010, the NBS intervened 14 times by selling foreign exchange (eight times by selling euros at auctions and six times by selling euros through the Reuters Dealing System—the NBS, as price taker, sells euros at the best quoted rates). The official middle exchange rate of the dinar against the euro is calculated at the end of each business day as the weighted average of the exchange rates applied in all individual transactions in the interbank spot foreign exchange market and as the weighted average of the exchange rates applied in all individual transactions in the interbank foreign exchange market with a settlement date of less than the spot value date. The NBS publishes information regarding the official middle rate of the dinar against the euro by 6:00 p.m., to be effective at 8:00 a.m. on the following business day. Official middle exchange rates of the dinar against 16 currencies (which are quoted in the NBSʹs exchange rate list for official middle exchange rates) are used for the purposes of bookkeeping, statistics, and calculation of customs duty and other import fees, as provided by Article 41 of the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations. In addition, exchange rates of the dinar against 10 currencies that are quoted in the NBSʹs exchange rate list for foreign exchange are used in trade between the NBS and residents holding FCAs with the NBS. According to Article 36 of the Foreign Exchange Law, resident budgetary and social security organizations, and bodies financed by local governmentʹs budget funds may have FCAs only with the NBS, unless otherwise stipulated by a special law or an international agreement. Exchange rates of the dinar against three currencies that are quoted in the NBSʹs exchange rate list for foreign cash were used in cash trade between the NBS and banks, as well as in trade between the NBS and licensed exchange dealers—until April 1, 2010, when the NBS stopped transacting with licensed exchange dealers. Exchange rates for foreign cash are also applied for the purposes of calculation and payments of foreign cash to residents holding FCAs with the NBS for the purposes of official travel. The NBS trades only in euros, dollars, and Swiss franc cash currencies. In addition to the official exchange rate lists, the NBS also publishes information on the indicative exchange rate of the dinar against the euro based on banksʹ reports on direct spot trade, spot sale, and purchase of foreign exchange (euros) to/from another bank, including trade with settlement date less than the spot value date. The NBS uses the two-week repo rate as the main monetary policy instrument to implement a monetary policy that is anchored by consumer price index (CPI) inflation targets in the context of full-fledged inflation targeting. The CPI inflation corridor, which should help ensure the stability of the general level of prices in 2008, was set at 6% to 10% in 2009 and 4% to 8% in 2010. Other monetary policy instruments, including interventions in the foreign exchange market, have only supporting roles."

Thus, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Operational guidelines specify the role of the CBS as the buyer/seller of last resort in the foreign exchange market. The reference exchange rate is calculated as a weighted average of all foreign currency buying and selling transactions by ADs (banks and bureaus) and telegraphic transfers/drafts and is used for accounting purposes and for conversion of payments in foreign currency as permitted by the Foreign Exchange Act. The operational target of the monetary policy is reserve money."
2009,724,Sierra Leone,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, with the exchange rate of the leone determined by the market. The leone started experiencing a pronounced depreciation in the third quarter of 2008, which continued thereafter. The depreciation is a result of the second-round effects of the financial turmoil, which has significantly affected the tradable sector, and the reduction in remittances from the diaspora. The auction, although used as a reference rate by market participants, constitutes only about 7% of official foreign exchange transactions and does not influence the exchange rate. Occasionally, the BSL buys or sells foreign exchange directly with banks outside the auctions. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement, effective November 1, 2008. The BSL published its weekly foreign exchange amount offered for sale and the result of the weekly foreign exchange auction on its website. The BSL determines the exchange rate used in official transactions, including for customs valuation purposes; the rate is based on the weighted average mid-rate of purchases and sales made by commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus during the preceding five business days, including the weekly auction rate. The monetary policy of the BSL aims to control monetary aggregates."
2009,576,Singapore,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The authorities manage the exchange rate as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the objective of maintaining price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. The Singapore dollar is allowed to fluctuate within a targeted policy band and is managed against a basket of currencies of the countryʹs major trading partners and competitors. The various currencies are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the countries in Singaporeʹs trade relations with the world. The exchange rate policy is announced every six months in the Monetary Policy Statement, typically in terms of changes to the slope of the policy band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. Accordingly, effective January 1, 2006, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to other managed arrangement from floating. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) does not publish information on its interventions. The monetary policy of the MAS is guided by an exchange rate target."

Thus, effective January 1, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement of the Slovak Republic has been reclassified to the category free floating (independently floating according to the methodology at the time of the reclassification) from the category pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Previously, the Slovak Republic entered into the ERM II, pegging the koruna to the euro at the central rate of Sk 38.4550 per euro, which was later adjusted to Sk 35.4424 per euro with a standard fluctuation band of ±15% around the central rate of the koruna. The ECB publishes information on its interventions but it has not intervened since 2000. The ECB publishes a reference rate based on the daily concertation procedure between CBs within and outside the European System of Central Banks, which normally takes place at 2:15 p.m. The reference rate against the euro is the average of the buying and selling rates. To maintain price stability is the primary objective of the Eurosystem and of the single monetary policy for which it is responsible. This is stated in the Treaty on the Functioning of the European Union, Article 127(1). “Without prejudice to the objective of price stability,” the Eurosystem will also “support the general economic policies in the Community with a view to contributing to the achievement of the objectives of the Community.” These include a “high level of employment” and “sustainable and non-inflationary growth.” Price stability is defined as an inflation rate below but close to 2%."

2009,146,Switzerland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market. However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free market rates. On March 12, 2009, the SNB announced its intention to act in order to prevent any further appreciation of the Swiss franc against the euro and to intervene in the foreign exchange market to this effect. Starting March 15, 2009, the SNB has intervened directly in the foreign exchange market. As a result, the Swiss franc has been stable against the euro. The de facto exchange rate arrangement has thus been reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement against the euro from free floating, effective March 15, 2009. The SNB reaffirmed its commitment to a free floating exchange rate and stressed the transitory nature of its intervention. Starting December 18, 2009, the Swiss franc no longer met the stabilized arrangement criteria. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating, effective December 18, 2009, from a stabilized arrangement. The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual accountability report. There is no official or reference exchange rate. Monetary policy implementation is based on an explicit definition of price stability—an annual consumer price index inflation rate less than 2%—as a long-term anchor. Policy decisions are guided by an inflation forecast over a three-year horizon. As an operational objective, the SNB announced a target range for the three-month Swiss franc LIBOR determined offshore. The SNB attempts to indirectly steer the LIBOR generally to the middle of this band, in particular by conducting repo transactions. A key communication device is an inflation forecast chart that indicates the SNBʹs policy bias. The use of LIBOR as an operational target stems from its considerable economic significance as a reference rate for many financial and lending contracts, including flexible-rate mortgages."

The exchange rate depreciated by 14% from January 1, 2009, to April 30, 2009, and the NBT announced a flexible foreign exchange arrangement. As a result, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement. Subsequently, as a result of monetary measures and foreign exchange interventions taken by the authorities starting in July 2009, the authorities stabilized the exchange rate of the somoni. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective August 1, 2009. The official exchange rate of the somoni against the dollar, euro, and ruble is determined and set daily by the NBT on the basis of the weighted average exchange rates of dollar, euro, and R ruble transactions in the interbank and intrabank foreign exchange markets as of 3:00 p.m. Exchange rates for other currencies are determined indirectly through cross-exchange rates of the dollar against these currencies. The official exchange rate is used for purposes of accounting and customs payments and does not serve as a basis for authorized banksʹ exchange rates in transactions with their clients. The official exchange rate is established without any obligation on the part of the NBT to purchase or sell currency at that exchange rate. The NBT aims to control monetary aggregates."

The BOT does not disclose information on its interventions. The baht-dollar reference exchange rate is announced daily, based on the weighted average exchange rate of the previous day. The baht-dollar reference exchange rate is widely used as a benchmark rate for marking to market the dollars held by funds and corporations as well as for calculating profit and loss as a result of foreign exchange transactions for accounting purposes. The BOT also uses the baht-dollar reference exchange rate to mark to market its foreign exchange reserves. The BOT has a formal inflation target of zero to 3.5% on a quarterly basis. It uses the one-day bilateral repurchase transaction rate as the key policy rate to signal the monetary policy stance."

However, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures. The Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange. Such intervention has aimed to augment international reserves or reduce volatility in exchange rate movements. The CBGʹs monetary operational target is reserve money. The CBG conducts a foreign exchange market review session on the last working day of each week with the participation of the commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus.

The Conference of Heads of State and Government may decide to amend the monetary cooperation agreement between the West African Monetary Union (WAMU) member countries and France. The monetary cooperation agreement established between WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU member states are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention that France and the BCEAO signed on September 20, 2005."

Since January 2009, the dinar has been very stable against a euro-dollar composite. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively from floating to a stabilized arrangement, effective January 15, 2009. The CBT applies a quantitative approach on the monetary basis, which is the operational target, and fine-tunes bank liquidity with open-market operations. The CBT does not release intervention data. The exchange rate of the dinar posted to the market by the CBT is purely indicative. The exchange rates for the dinar published by the CBT are calculated on the basis of a basket of international foreign currencies.

The exchange rate of the lira is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market in case of unstable price movements in exchange rates. The CBRT announced the general framework of the monetary and exchange rate policies envisaged for 2009 in a press release titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2009” of December 16, 2008. Having a strong foreign exchange reserve position was stated as the general strategy of the CBRT. Daily selling auctions to provide dollars to the market were held from March 10, 2009, through April 2, 2009, for $50 million each day. The stabilization of the foreign exchange market has contributed to a buildup of foreign exchange reserves; effective August 4, 2009, the foreign exchange buying auctions, which had been suspended October 16, 2008, were resumed. The maximum daily amount to be purchased in auctions is $60 million, with a set auction amount of $30 million and an optional selling amount of $30 million (previously, the set auction amount was $15 million, and successful bidders had the option to sell up to 200% of their successful bid amount at the average auction price). Other auction terms have not been changed. The CBRT publishes the results of its daily auctions on its website. Effective August 4, 2009, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to free floating from floating, because CBRT deals in the foreign exchange market for reserve management only, and its transactions are implemented in a way that has minimal influence on the exchange rate. The CBRT has a formal inflation-targeting framework. The target is 6.5% for 2010. Regarding 2011 and 2012, the targets are 5.5% and 5%, respectively. In order to determine the indicative exchange rates, the CBRT makes six observations between 10:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m., with one-hour intervals, by taking the average value of the averages of the buying and selling rates as quoted by banks in the interbank foreign exchange market for $1. The arithmetic average of the six observed values thus obtained is the CBRTʹs indicative foreign exchange selling rate of $1 to be announced at 3:30 p.m. Similarly, the respective cross rates of the currencies for which the CBRT announces indicative exchange rates are collected between 10:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. at one-hour intervals.

Effective May 7, 2009, it is set as the weighted average of selling and buying exchange rates in the interbank foreign exchange market of Ukraine of the previous business day, within a 2% range. In accordance with the Constitution of Ukraine and the Law on the NBU, the main function of the NBBU is to provide for stability of the domestic monetary unit. To this end, the NBU influences the exchange rate without planning a specific path or exchange rate target. Interventions may be both direct and indirect. The NBU publishes information about its interventions in the interbank foreign exchange market. The official exchange rate of the hryvnia against foreign currencies and bank metals is used by residents and nonresidents to account for transactions with foreign exchange and bank metals and for the execution of transactions by the NBU with the State Treasury of Ukraine. In accordance with the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF, the operational target indicators for the countryʹs monetary policy are the monetary aggregate (base money) and observance of the floor on international reserves."

The BOE pursues an explicit inflation target—currently 2%. It seeks to meet the inflation target through the Monetary Policy Committeeʹs decisions. The BOE calculates reference exchange rates on a daily basis and publishes these on its website. They are used as a reference point, including for SDR calculations. Exchange rates are determined as middle spot rates prevailing in the interbank market at a given point in time."
2009,111,United States,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the dollar is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are not formally ruled out in the United States, but they are rarely used. The secretary of the treasury is responsible for the formulation and implementation of international monetary and financial policy, including exchange market intervention policy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has separate legal authority to engage in foreign exchange operations. The Fedʹs foreign exchange operations are conducted in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury to ensure consistency with U.S. international monetary and financial policy. The Treasury and the Fed have closely coordinated their foreign exchange operations since early 1962, when the Fed commenced such operations at the request of the Treasury. Operations are conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as fiscal agent of the United States and as the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. Interventions are reported in the Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations quarterly bulletin. There were no interventions during 2009. The monetary policy aims at maintaining long-term growth of the monetary and credit aggregates commensurate with the economyʹs long-term potential to increase production and promote maximum employment, stable prices, and moderate long-term interest rates. The United States does not compute or publish an official or reference exchange rate."
2009,298,Uruguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the peso is determined on the basis of supply and demand, although the CBU reserves the right to intervene to avert abrupt changes in a concentrated market with few transactions. The dollar is the intervention currency. The CBU publishes information on interventions on its website. The monetary policy framework is inflation targeting, although a formal inflation-targeting framework is not yet in place."
2009,927,Uzbekistan,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. Since 2001, the exchange rate of the dollar has been determined on the basis of interbank trading sessions (ITS). Since March 2008, the ITS also include euro operations. The sum has gradually depreciated against the dollar. The official exchange rate of the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is determined once a week as the average ITS rate for the previous week, and it remains in effect for one week. The official exchange rate of the CBU is used for accounting purposes, for statistical and other reporting on foreign exchange operations, and for the calculation of customs and other mandatory payments in the territory of Uzbekistan."
2009,846,Vanuatu,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Officially, the external value of the vatu is determined on the basis of an undisclosed transaction-weighted basket of currencies of Vanuatuʹs major trading and tourism partners, including the Australian dollar, the euro, the New Zealand dollar, the U.S. dollar, and the yen. In practice, the vatu has experienced slightly more volatility against any possible currency composites than the 2% band typical of stabilized or pegged arrangements. The Reserve Bank of Vanuatu (RBV) quotes vatu rates daily against the U.S. dollar, the Australian dollar, the euro, the yen, the New Zealand dollar, and the pound sterling. Buying and selling rates of the vatu against the currencies in the basket are quoted once a day within margins ranging between 0.25% and 0.30% around the middle rate."
2009,299,Venezuela,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The bolívar is pegged to the dollar. Effective January 1, 2008, a monetary reconversion process eliminated three zeros from the national currency. The bolívar-dollar exchange rate is currently expressed as Bs 2.14 (buying) and Bs 2.15 (selling) per dollar. Venezuela devalued its currency from Bs 2.15 per dollar to Bs 4.30 per dollar for most imports on January 8, 2009. A second rate of Bs 2.60 per dollar is used for imports of food, medicine, and machinery. The Central Bank of Venezuela (CBV) may provide the government $7 billion in reserves to intervene in the bolívar parallel market."
2009,582,Vietnam,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"""The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) announces the daily average interbank exchange rate against the dollar; authorized credit institutions (CIs) base their bid and offer quotes on this rate. The official exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand of foreign exchange in the market. There is no preannounced path for the central rate. Effective November 26, 2009, the SBV reverted to its previous policy of a ±3% dollar-dong trading band around the rate quoted by the SBV with a one-step devaluation of about 5½ percent in the central rate. Previously, the trading band was widened to ±5% on March 24, 2009. The dong stabilized at the lowest edge of the band in January 2009, which has been lowered several times since then. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement against the dollar from other managed arrangement, effective January 1, 2009. The SBV does not release its intervention data. The official exchange rate applied to purchases of foreign currency from the government generally is the interbank average exchange rate."
2009,754,Zambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is floating. The official exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) intervenes in the market primarily through transactions with ADs, which are all registered commercial banks. The interbank rates provide the basis for determining the BOZ exchange rates: the BOZʹs buying rate is the simple average of the AD slow-bid rates, and the BOZʹs selling rate is the simple average of the primary dealersʹ high-offer rates. The BOZʹs monetary policy aims to control inflation using monetary aggregates as the anchor. BOZ interventions in the market are published as historical data, and its foreign exchange transactions are published in the fortnightly statistics."
2009,698,Zimbabwe,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"Effective January 1, 2010, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The use of the Zimbabwe dollar as domestic currency has been discontinued for economic, financial, and administrative purposes over the period 2010—12, for economic, financial, and administrative purposes. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender from other managed arrangement, effective January 1, 2010."
2010,914,Albania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lek is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) normally is not active in this market. Per its regulations, intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) Severe and adverse movements in the exchange rate of the lek: These are cases of excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market. Such situations are considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementation of Monetary Policy, which seeks to avoid intervening in the foreign exchange market. However, lack of depth in the foreign exchange market accompanied by pronounced seasonal factors (i.e., seasonal increases in the supply of foreign currency in the summer months and in December and stronger imports during the first part of the year) can result in fast one-way movements, which may disrupt activity in the domestic foreign exchange market. The bid-ask spreads may widen up to 1%, and at times banks do not deal with each other at all. In such circumstances, intervention may be used to restore calm to a disorderly market and to smooth the seasonal trends. (2) Considerable exchange rate misalignment with fundamentals: The lek is considered misaligned with fundamentals if there is a lengthy overshooting of the exchange rate. (3) A need to accumulate foreign reserves to meet the net international reserves (NIR) target: The NIR target is included each year in the BOAʹs monetary program. When the BOA intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange markets, its counterparties are the commercial banks, but when necessary, the BOA may carry out its interventions with foreign exchange bureaus. The BOA conducts interventions through (1) verbal interventions, in the form of press releases in the print or electronic media and/or press conferences; and (2) transactional interventions. The intervention exchange rate is determined by commercial banksʹ quotes and the BOA Monetary Operations Departmentʹs quotes. When the intervention exchange rate is uniform for all counterparties, the BOA publishes that rate on its Reuters page and, at the same time, communicates the exchange rate to the commercial banks that do not participate in the Reuters system and to the foreign exchange bureaus with which it has contact. When different exchange rates are used, the BOA announces only the fact that it has intervened; it publishes with a three-month lag the amount of the intervention in a quarterly bulletin that summarizes its foreign exchange operations with banks and the public sector. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2010,612,Algeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Bank of Algeria (BA) does not announce the future path of the exchange rate. The external value of the dinar is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the BA is the main seller because of the significant inflows related to commodity exports, including hydrocarbons, which, under current law, must be surrendered to the BA. The BA manages the dinar with reference to a basket of currencies. The rate of the dinar relative to the currencies in the basket is based on balance of payments data. The BA has not set a target range for fluctuation of the dinar outside or within any particular band and the observed exchange rate movements do not confirm any constant weights of the currency composite. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BA does not disclose any information about its interventions."
2010,614,Angola,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. However, the BNA intervenes actively in the foreign exchange market in order to sterilize foreign currency inflows in the form of taxes paid by oil companies. The BNA intervenes in the primary foreign exchange market exclusively through foreign exchange auctions. Although it announces the volume for sale before the auction, the BNA has a policy of holding as many auctions a day as needed to satisfy the entire demand, which led to the stability of the kwanza exchange rate. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BNA does not publish data on its interventions."
2010,311,Antigua and Barbuda,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Antigua and Barbuda participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2010,213,Argentina,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, and the exchange rate of the peso, which is determined in the MULC by the interplay of supply and demand, is applied to all transactions in foreign exchange and foreign currency banknotes. The BCRA intervenes in the foreign exchange market to execute its reserve accumulation and management policy, which acts as a stabilizer in the event of temporary changes in conditions. The BCRA makes no explicit or implicit commitment with respect to the exchange rate level or pathway. The BCRAʹs participation in the foreign exchange market declined in 2010, while the; traded volume declined to 6.1% in 2010 from 8.8% in 2009. Despite the reduction in volume, the peso closely followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar since January 2010. Market supply and demand play a role in determining the exchange rate, as does official action based on the observed path of the exchange rate and information on intervention and reserves buildup. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement from floating, effective January 1, 2010. The BCRA publishes its net purchases in a weekly foreign exchange report."
2010,911,Armenia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. Since March 3, 2009, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) has limited its role as a supplier in the foreign exchange market, thus returning to a de facto floating exchange rate regime. This allows the exchange rate to find a level more in line with existing macroeconomic fundamentals. The CBA intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility, which is defined as short-term/high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by speculative or trend-following elements, rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals, which impose significant costs on the economy. The CBA intervenes only anonymously through the stock exchange, but it may also intervene in the interbank market, which is not anonymous. The CBA publishes weekly intervention data on its website with a one-week lag. Reflecting exchange rate developments, in particular the absence of CBA interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Since March 2009, the CBA has been active in the foreign exchange market, resulting in limited exchange rate flexibility; nonetheless, the exchange rate remained more volatile than the minimum required for a stabilized arrangement."
2010,314,Aruba,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The legal documents that established the fixed exchange rate arrangement are AB 1992 No. GT 6 State Decree for Fixing Parity of the Aruban florin and Notice on Foreign Exchange Transactions 90/A2.
2010,193,Australia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the RBA retains discretionary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The RBA may also vary the way the intervention is conducted; it may enter the interbank foreign exchange market directly through the electronic brokerage market or use an agent bank. Given the high level of development of the Australian foreign exchange market, interventions are rare. As a matter of government policy, all wholesale purchases of foreign currency by government agencies are made through the RBA. The RBA manages the flows from any purchases on behalf of the government so as to minimize their market impact. The current de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. Monthly purchases and sales of foreign exchange are published on the RBA website."
2010,122,Austria,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Austria participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2011, 16 other members of the EU (previously 15; now including Estonia) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2010,912,Azerbaijan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. The CBA influences the market exchange rate through the official rate and interventions in the foreign exchange market. The CBA intervenes in the market within the intervention corridor determined around the official rate. Following the transition in March 2008 to a euro–U.S. dollar basket peg, the CBA first increased and then reduced the weight of the euro, resulting in a de facto peg against the U.S. dollar. Effective January 20, 2011, the peg against the basket was abandoned and a bilateral peg against the U.S. dollar has been implemented, thereby continuing the de facto peg vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The CBA publishes its foreign exchange intervention data in its quarterly reports."
2010,419,Bahrain,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rate is indicated in the Official Gazette of the CBB.
2010,513,Bangladesh,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been floating since May 31, 2003. Bangladesh Bank (BB) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Bangladesh Bank buys and sells foreign currency in the foreign exchange market at the prevailing rate. In calendar year 2010, BB bought and sold 843 and 400 million USD, respectively, in the interbank market. Against the backdrop of significant interventions, the exchange rate arrangement remained stable against the U.S. dollar within a narrow band through end-September 2010. On October 4, 2010, the taka depreciated by nearly 1.6% and has been following a depreciating trend against the dollar. Therefore, effective October 4, 2010, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to crawl-like arrangement from stabilized arrangement. Bangladesh Bank publishes information on its interventions."
2010,316,Barbados,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The minister of finance, after consultation with the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), pegged the Barbados dollar in relation to the U.S. dollar on July 5, 1975, pursuant to the Exchange Control Act and the Central Bank of Barbados Act. Intervention data are published in Economic and Financial Statistics Section H, Table 2."
2010,913,Belarus,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is a pegged exchange rate within a horizontal band. Since January 2, 2009, the exchange rate of the rubel has been pegged to a basket of currencies, including the euro, the U.S. dollar, and the Russian ruble. Initially, the band was set at ±5% around the value of the basket at the time of its introduction (Rbl 960). Since June 2009, the band has been ±10% relative to the value of the basket at the time of its introduction. Effective January 1, 2011, the central exchange rate of the band has been adjusted to the actual value of the basket, Rbl 1,054.68 established December 31, 2010 (previously, it was adjusted to Rbl 1,036.27, effective January 1, 2010). Exchange rate policy in 2010 was aimed at maintaining the rubel against the basket of foreign currencies near parity values in order to limit inflation pressure and curb devaluation expectations. As a result, in 2010 the maximum strengthening of the rubel against the basket of currencies amounted to 2.6%, and the weakening to −4.6%, which remained within the parameters of the exchange rate policy set for 2010. Vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, the rubel has remained in a 2% band since May 2010. Thus, effective May 7, 2010, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. The National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) does not publish data on its interventions."
2010,124,Belgium,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Belgium participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2011, 16 other members of the EU (previously 15; now including Estonia) and has no separate legal tender.

2010,339,Belize,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Belize dollar is officially pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at the rate of BZ$1 per US$0.5, as established by the Central Bank Act. The CB does not publish its intervention data."
2010,638,Benin,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Benin participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2010,514,Bhutan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. Indian rupee banknotes and coins circulate freely in Bhutan.
2010,218,Bolivia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg to the U.S. dollar, characterized by small fluctuations for which no prior notice is given. The Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) determines the floor price on the daily competitive foreign exchange auctions (bolsín) in which the financial system participates. The rate of crawl was equal to zero from October 2008 through November 30, 2010. Since then, small periodic adjustments have taken place, but the boliviano has remained within a tight band of less than 2%. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar. The CBB publishes data on its exchange market interventions and on its purchases and sales of foreign exchange in the “Weekly Statistics” section of its website."
2010,963,Bosnia and Herzegovina,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The CB covers base money with its foreign reserves, including currency in circulation and commercial bank deposits. The Law on the Central Bank, adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, guarantees convertibility of the currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are no restrictions on the purchase and sale of foreign exchange. The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) does not publish data on its sales and purchases."
2010,616,Botswana,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The exchange rate of the pula is officially determined with reference to a weighted basket of currencies composed of the SDR and the South African rand. The rate of crawl of the pula is set as the difference between the Bank of Botswanaʹs (BOBʹs) inflation objective and the inflation forecast in major trading partner countries. The rate of crawl is thus determined using a forward-looking approach and is revised on a regular basis. In this forward-looking scheme, the authorities periodically determine the rate of crawl for the subsequent period, such as the next six or twelve months."
2010,223,Brazil,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the real is determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market in which the Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) participates. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The CBB deals at rates quoted by participants in the interbank market. The CBB publishes the amount of its daily interventions on its website. The information is updated once a week.
2010,516,Brunei Darussalam,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The AMBD, which replaced the Brunei Currency and Monetary Board (BCMB), effective January 1, 2011, issues Brunei dollars and manages the newly established Currency Fund. Under the terms of the Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA), signed in 1967, which remains in effect between the AMBD and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the monetary authorities agreed to the mutual exchange of each otherʹs currency at par without charge. Government authorities and banks must accept each otherʹs currency at par, and the currencies are customary tender in both countries. Excess currency is repatriated regularly, and the cost of repatriation is borne by the currency-issuing authority. The AMBD must ensure that reserves cover at least 100% of base money. The AMBD publishes data on the reserves used to cover the base money through the IMF. Previously, this information was published in the BCMBʹs annual reports."
2010,918,Bulgaria,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board arrangement was introduced by the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) of 1997. The national currency was pegged initially to the German mark and subsequently to the euro. The Law on the BNB adopted in 1997 was a conceptually new legal act, introducing the currency board mechanism, and cannot be considered an amendment to the previous law, similarly called the Law on the BNB, which was in effect until 1997 and repealed by the new law. Aggregate data for daily euro/lev turnover between the BNB and local banks are published on Reutersʹ page NBOB3. Yearly aggregates are available in the annual report."

The Bank of the Republic of Burundi (BRB) publishes data on its Marché des Enchères Symétrique en Devises (MESD) transactions on its website. The Burundi franc exchange rate, which is mainly determined at the BRB auction, has been within a ±1% band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar with very little volatility since May 2009. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against the dollar."
2010,522,Cambodia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. Given the high degree of financial dollarization, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to accommodate demand for riels and maintain exchange rate stability. There was a one-time adjustment in the path of riel-U.S. dollar exchange rate in November 2010. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Detailed data on intervention are available on request."
2010,622,Cameroon,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. Cameroon participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CAEMC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (“Joint Monetary Committee”) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to renounce the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of any member from the BEAC automatically results in that memberʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2010,156,Canada,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, with the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar determined on the basis of supply and demand. However, in accordance with an intervention policy, which is established by the government in close consultation with the Bank of Canada (BOC), the BOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market on behalf of the federal government to counter disruptive short-term movements in the exchange rate. Canadaʹs current policy is to intervene in foreign exchange markets on a discretionary, rather than a systematic, basis and only in the most exceptional circumstances. The BOC has not intervened since September 1998. When an intervention occurs, an announcement is made on the BOCʹs website. The amount of the intervention is available in the governmentʹs monthly official press release on international reserves."
2010,624,Cape Verde,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Ministries of Finance and CBs of Portugal and Cape Verde are the institutions that can decide to change the exchange rate arrangement.

2010,228,Chile,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate of the peso is freely determined in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Chile (CBC) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market to keep the currency near its equilibrium value in order to avoid costly reversals in the future. These interventions take the form of transparent, well-founded measures, which include explicit definitions of the periods and amounts involved and clearly explained reasons for these exceptional interventions. The CBC usually announces the amount of foreign exchange it intends to buy or sell in its monthly bulletin. Since the end of the second auction program on November 20, 2009, the government has not asked the CBC to implement any similar programs. On January 3, 2011, the CBC announced that it was launching a foreign currency purchasing program aimed at strengthening its international liquidity position, effective January 5, 2011, through daily auctions to buy US$50 million up to a total of US$12 billion. From January 5, to April 30, 2011, the CBC purchased US$50 million consistently in daily auctions, while it reserves the right to revise the auction amount responding to market conditions. The CBC publishes its auction results on a daily basis and publishes its reserves on a weekly basis."
2010,924,China,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"China officially maintains a de jure managed floating exchange rate arrangement based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies. On June 19, 2010, the Peopleʹs Bank of China (PBC) announced a more flexible exchange rate regime to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy. As a result, the RMB gradually appreciated against the U.S. dollar (by 4.7% until April 30, 2011), while the rate remained within a 2% crawling band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective June 21, 2010. Previously, the RMB had been stabilized within a range of ±1%, since mid-2008. The PBC does not publish its intervention data."
2010,233,Colombia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. All foreign exchange transactions are conducted at a market-determined exchange rate; however, the Banco de la República (BR) intervenes in the foreign exchange market, at its discretion or in compliance with guidelines established by the board of directors, to adjust the level of international reserves, limit excess volatility of the exchange rate, and influence the speed of adjustment of the nominal exchange rate. The monthly results of the BRʹs intervention on the foreign exchange market and information regarding each auction are available on the BR website. Effective March 3, 2010, the BR restarted the accumulation of international reserves through direct purchase auctions at US$20 million a day through June 30, 2010, in compliance with the announcement by the BR. Effective July 1, 2010, the daily direct purchase auctions were suspended. Effective September 15, 2010, the BR reinstated the auctions with daily purchases of at least US$20 million and announced that the auctions would continue for four months until January 15, 2011. However, on October 29, 2010, the BR announced that the auctions were being extended until March 15, 2011, on February 25, 2011, the BR announced that the auctions were being extended further until June 17, 2011, and on May 30, 2011, announced that the auctions were being extended further until September 30, 2011. In addition, effective October 14, 2010, the BR strengthened its instruments for exchange rate intervention by linking the BR to the Colombian Foreign Currency Clearing House, S.A."
2010,632,Comoros,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Comoros participates in the franc zone area. The monetary cooperation agreement established between CAEMC member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. The exchange rate arrangement is established in the following documents: (1) the Monetary Cooperation Agreement between the Comorian and French governments, November 23, 1979; (2) the decision by the European Council of Ministers authorizing France to maintain its monetary arrangements with both the CFA zone countries and the Comoros, November 23, 1998; and (3) the order by the governor of the Central Bank of Comoros (CBC) on euro–Comorian franc parity, January 14, 1999."
2010,238,Costa Rica,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Since October 17, 2006, the de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a crawling band arrangement characterized by an increasing width. The band is defined in terms of colones per U.S. dollar and does not include a central parity. The lower and upper bounds of the band are adjusted to allow the exchange rate more room to respond continuously to economic fundamentals and short-term fluctuations in the foreign exchange market. On January 23, 2009, the crawl rate of the bandʹs upper bound was defined as C 0.20 per U.S. dollar a business day, reflecting an annual rate of depreciation of about 9%; the lower bound (buying exchange rate) remained at C 500.00 per U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2010, the intervention selling exchange rate had reached C 661.85, indicating a band of 32.4%. The Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR) publishes its intervention data daily for the preceding day. Since August 12, 2009, the average exchange rate on the foreign currency market (MONEX) has fluctuated freely within the limits of the fluctuation band. In 2010, however, the amount of foreign exchange available on the exchange market increased, which pushed the exchange rate for the U.S. dollar close to the lower bound of the band (except in May). The exchange rate reached the lower bound on December 15 and 16, 2010, forcing the BCCR to intervene and purchase US$16.3 million. Effective September 2, 2010, in order to strengthen the economyʹs external assets position, the BCCR board approved a program to increase international reserves by US$600 million (BCCR Circular No. JD-5471/05/02 of September 1, 2010), with a maximum purchase of US$50 million a month between September 2, 2010, and December 31, 2011. Effective November 4, 2010, the BCCR board (BCCR No. JD-5477/14/02 of November 3, 2010) raised the ceiling on monthly purchases under the program from US$50 million to US$100 million a month for November and December 2010 and 2011 and to US$75 million a month for the remaining months of 2011. Under this program, the BCCR acquired US$265.3 million in 2010 and US$334.7 million in 2011. Effective April 18, 2011, the FX purchase program for accumulating international reserves has been concluded as the US$600 million target was reached. As the result of a wide fluctuation band and the continued control of the BCCR over the exchange rate determination, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2010,662,Côte dʹIvoire,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Côte dʹIvoire participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2010,960,Croatia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating without a predetermined path. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) may set intervention exchange rates, which it applies in transactions with banks outside the interbank market to limit exchange rate volatility. Since June 2010, the kuna has gradually depreciated against the euro in a narrow band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective June 17, 2010. Intervention data (prices and volume) are published on the CNB website."

2010,423,Cyprus,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Cyprus participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2011, 16 other members of the EU (previously 15; now including Estonia) and has no separate legal tender. The euro floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2010,935,Czech Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The external value of the koruna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) participates. The CNB pursues a program of sales of foreign exchange reserves revenues aimed at preventing the level of reserves from continuing to rise. The CNB publishes its monthly foreign exchange transaction data on its website, with a two-month lag. In addition to the program of sales and conversion of EU funds and privatization receipts, the CNB last intervened in September 2002. It used only local market makers and traded at their rates. Apart from the aforementioned CNB participation in the foreign exchange market, there are off-market conversions of EU transfers and, in the past, there were conversions of large privatization receipts."
2010,636,Democratic Republic of the Congo,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The exchange rate of the Congo franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The BCC, while observing the international reserves target in its monetary program, intervenes to channel back to the market some of the reserves accumulated from external flows. This is done in the context of an auction, which is the only operational framework for the BCCʹs transactions with the market. The BCC has intervened on both sides of the market. As a result, the franc has gradually depreciated against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band since May 2010. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from floating, effective May 5, 2010."
2010,128,Denmark,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The formal framework for the Danish fixed exchange rate policy is the ERM II. Denmark participates in the ERM II with a central rate of DKr 746.038 per €100. The central rate is a conversion of the central rate vis-à-vis the deutsche mark before the third stage of the EMU and was last adjusted in January 1987. Denmark has entered into an agreement with the ECB and the euro area member countries on a narrower fluctuation band of ±2.25%. In recent years, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) has consistently maintained a stable krone within less than 1% of the central rate. The DNʹs net purchase or sale of foreign currency during a month is published at 4:00 p.m. on the second working day of the following month in the “Foreign Exchange and Liquidity” press release. The agreement on Denmarkʹs fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro within a narrow fluctuation band of ±2.25% around the central rate in ERM II was concluded at the informal meeting of the Ecofin Council of September 25–27, 1998, in Vienna, between the ministers for economy and finance and the CB governors of the EU member countries."
2010,611,Djibouti,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"Djiboutiʹs monetary system is based on a currency board. The Djibouti franc has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1949, but the legislation establishing the currency board and determining the fixed exchange rate is Law No. 91/AN/05/5èmeL of January 16, 2005. The Central Bank of Djibouti (BCD) guarantees and provides for unlimited conversion into U.S. dollars of banknotes and coins used as legal tender in Djibouti. The full issue of Djibouti francs is covered by foreign exchange reserves. The National Assembly of Djibouti has the authority to make decisions regarding changes in the exchange rate arrangement."

2010,243,Dominican Republic,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. As part of the Fund-supported program, the CBDR is in the process transitioning to an inflation-targeting framework to be fully adopted in early 2012 with intent to increase the flexibility of the exchange rate. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit exchange rate volatility. Since February 2010, the peso has depreciated gradually within a narrow band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, effective February 1, 2010, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement from a stabilized arrangement. The CBDR publishes data on foreign exchange sales and purchases in the foreign exchange market by different institutional actors (banks, exchange houses, and remittance houses). The data are published on a net basis."

2010,469,Egypt,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate is determined through supply and demand in the foreign exchange interbank market, and the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) buys and sells foreign exchange daily at the rate prevailing in the interbank market. The CBE does not publish its intervention data. From March 2009 through January 2010, the pound gradually appreciated against a euro–U.S. dollar basket, followed by a gradual depreciation since then. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement against a composite from other managed arrangement, effective March 12, 2009."

On January 1, 2001, the U.S. dollar became unrestricted legal tender with unlimited redeemability for the settlement of debt throughout El Salvador. The U.S. dollar is used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange. The Central Reserve Bank (CRB) is obligated to exchange colones in circulation for U.S. dollars on request from banks at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per U.S. dollar."
2010,642,Equatorial Guinea,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. Equatorial Guinea participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CAEMC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory states (“Joint Monetary Committee”) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to renounce the agreement.

According to the Foreign Exchange Law, the denar exchange rate is freely determined on the basis of demand and supply of foreign exchange in the foreign exchange market. However, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) participates in the foreign exchange market in order to maintain a stable exchange rate. Thus, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The NBRM publishes data on daily turnover of the foreign exchange market, which also includes information on NBRM intervention. The NBRM publishes its intervention data on a regular basis in the Quarterly Reports and in the Report on the Management of Foreign Reserves."

In March 2009, the authorities introduced a multiple-price foreign exchange auction and phased out their direct intervention to influence the price of the lari on the market. Since May 25, 2009, the authorities have intervened only through auctions. In light of the improved functioning of the foreign exchange market and the enhanced flexibility of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to floating from other managed arrangement, effective January 1, 2010."

2010,258,Guatemala,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. In accordance with the Monetary Law and the Free Foreign Exchange Convertibility Law, Guatemala has a flexible exchange rate arrangement in which the exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market by the supply of and demand for foreign exchange. However, the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the nominal exchange rate, without affecting its trend. The BOG intervenes through foreign exchange auctions based on a transparent rule, which limits daily volatility. The BOG may also intervene on a discretionary basis whenever the nominal exchange rate shows unusual volatility. In 2010, the BOG purchased US$152.55 million (on 21 occasions) and sold US$155.20 million (on 16 occasions), most of which took place during the first quarter, when the quetzal appreciated very rapidly against the U.S. dollar. After a relatively stable period during the second and third quarters, the exchange rate resumed its appreciating trend. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Intervention data are publicly available on the BOGʹs website."

Guinea announced its participation in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which formally limits the fluctuation of the franc to ±15% around a central rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, but this has yet to be implemented. The CB intervenes heavily at times, the rate seems rigid, and a black market premium persists. Given the frequent changes in the foreign exchange operational framework, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement.

Reflecting the stability of the Guyana dollar against the U.S. dollar as a result of interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2010,263,Haiti,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Due to the gourdeʹs stability against the U.S. dollar in a 2% depreciating trend, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a crawl-like arrangement from April 1, 2008, through January 10, 2010. In the immediate aftermath of the January 2010 earthquake, the exchange rate market was disrupted and remained uncertain until the end of January. Because of an initial collapse in demand for foreign currency, followed by foreign exchange inflows after the earthquake, the gourde resumed trading at a sharply appreciated level on January 26, 2010. No discernible exchange rate pattern could be identified throughout February. Thus, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from a crawl-like arrangement to other managed arrangement, effective January 11, 2010. Since March 2010, the gourde has gradually depreciated against the U.S. dollar in a 2% band, reverting to its preearthquake pattern. Therefore, effective March 3, 2010, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement from other managed arrangement. Foreign exchange sales and purchases by the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) are used for smoothing exchange rate fluctuations. The BRH publishes weekly information on foreign exchange interventions on its website."
2010,268,Honduras,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling band. The exchange rate of the lempira is determined by foreign exchange auctions of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). Since May 2008, the BCH has maintained an operational band requiring all bid prices for the purchase of foreign exchange to be within a range of 7% above or below the base price, with such prices subject to the requirement that bids for auctions not exceed 0.075% of the average reference exchange rate (TCR) derived from auctions concluded within the seven preceding business days. The authorities have maintained a policy of meeting all admissible bids within a 7% band above or below the base price, thus effectively pegging the exchange rate vis-à-vis the dollar at the floor of the band. The base price is determined according to a procedure established by the BCH board of directors for this purpose, which may include the following variables: the differential between the domestic inflation rate and the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners, changes in the exchange rates of these countriesʹ currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and the performance of official reserve assets. The external inflation rate is considered to be the weighted average of the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners. Domestic inflation is measured by the consumer price index. The change in the U.S. dollar exchange rates of the main trading partners is measured using the effective exchange rate index, which is compiled weekly on the basis of the weighted average of the exchange rates of the main trading partners expressed in units of their respective currencies to US$1.00. Finally, an adjustment factor is applied to the base price of the auction, depending on the number of months of imports covered by the BCHʹs reserve assets."
2010,532,Hong Kong SAR,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires the monetary base to be backed by the reserve currency (U.S. dollar) around an exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75–HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—has been used since May 18, 2005. The monetary base includes the notes and coins issued, the balance held with the HKMA of banksʹ clearing accounts (i.e., the aggregate balance), and outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Consistent with currency board principles, the HKMA may issue additional Exchange Fund paper when there is an inflow of funds, and the size of the program is allowed to expand along with the interest payments on such paper. Issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which provide backing for banknotes issued by banks, must be made against U.S. dollars at the fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. Issuance and withdrawal of government-issued notes and coins are settled against U.S. dollars at the same fixed rate. The legal documents that establish the currency board include the Basic Law (Chapter V, Section 1, Articles 110 and 111); Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66); and Exchange of Letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong SAR under the Exchange Fund Ordinance. In the Exchange of Letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority, it was specified that the Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong SAR, including the linked exchange rate. Section 3(1) of the Ordinance as amended specifies that the Exchange Fund “shall be under the control of the Financial Secretary and shall be used primarily for such purposes as the Financial Secretary thinks fit affecting, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong SAR and for other purposes incidental thereto.” On the other hand, the HKMA is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments, and operational means for doing so, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary system of Hong Kong SAR. The HKMA makes immediate announcements of the impact on the aggregate balance due to purchases or sales of U.S. dollars by the Currency Board via various information vendors, including Reuters and Bloomberg. The information is also available on the HKMA website."
2010,944,Hungary,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating because of the discretionary interventions made by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) in the foreign exchange market. The possible objectives of foreign exchange intervention are listed in the MNBʹs intervention strategy, which has not been published. The strategy aims to avoid disruptive market fluctuation and exchange rate overshooting. However, the strategy emphasizes that the MNB generally refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange market. The MNB converts foreign currency for the government and the net current and capital transfers from the EU on the foreign exchange market at foreign exchange market rates. These transactions change the foreign exchange reserve position of the MNB. If the resulting reserve dynamics are not in line with the MNBʹs reserve management objectives, some of the funds are channeled to the market. Transactions are conducted in small amounts at market prices. The MNB announced the policy of channeling the foreign exchange position resulting from the government-related foreign exchange flows to the market. The net amounts are published quarterly."
2010,176,Iceland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) regularly intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market.

The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBIʹs role is to modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. The RBI has no fixed or preannounced target or band for the exchange rate. In its interventions, the RBI purchases and sells U.S. dollars spot and forward in the interbank market at the market exchange rate. The RBI deals only with ADs. The RBI publishes monthly data on its interventions (foreign exchange purchases and sales) in both the spot and the forward markets in the RBI Monthly Bulletin."
2010,536,Indonesia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating (adopted on August 14, 1997). The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Bank Indonesia (BI), however, may intervene in the foreign exchange market—as part of a policy mix—whenever necessary to achieve the inflation target, as well as the stability of rupiah exchange rate. In conducting the intervention, BI does not target a specific level of rupiah exchange rate or maintain exchange rate movements in a specific band. From June 2010 through February 2011, the rupiah consistently remained within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from floating, effective June 21, 2010. In February, the exchange rate left the stabilized band as the rupiah started appreciating against the U.S. dollar. Due to the increased flexibility of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate has been reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement, effective February 14, 2011. BI does not disclose data on its interventions."
2010,433,Iraq,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has allowed the exchange rate to appreciate gradually vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar following a predetermined path. Within these limits, the exchange rate of the dinar is determined in the foreign exchange market. Since January 2009, the CBI has set the rate of crawl at zero, stabilizing the exchange rate at about ID 1,170 per U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against the dollar. The intervention data are published on the CBI website."
2010,178,Ireland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Ireland participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2011, 16 other members of the EU (previously 15; now including Estonia) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2010,512,Islamic Republic of Afghanistan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. In the absence of alternative monetary policy instruments, the DAB intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market in the form of twice-weekly selling foreign exchange auctions. The auction results are published on the DAB website. The DAB deals with ADs only through the auction. The primary goal of these auctions is to control the growth of reserve money and/or currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction exchange rate volatility. The Afghani remained stable against the U.S. dollar between September 2010 and March 31, 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to stabilized arrangement from floating, effective September 6, 2010. Due to the increased flexibility in the Afghani–U.S. dollar exchange rate since the beginning of April 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from stabilized arrangement, effective April 1, 2011."
2010,429,Islamic Republic of Iran,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed floating arrangement against a basket of currencies. Although the authorities remain in control of the exchange rate, the rialʹs volatility against the U.S. dollar, euro, and yen increased in 2008. However, since June 10, 2009, the rial has stabilized within a 2% band against a composite. The rial depreciated markedly at the beginning of October 2010 and stabilized anew against the basket. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite."
2010,436,Israel,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate policy is based on a free float of the new shekel vis-à-vis other currencies, and for many years the Bank of Israel (BOI) has pursued a policy of nonintervention in the foreign exchange market. However, the BOI retains the option to intervene through the purchase or sale of foreign currency in the interbank market, should the need arise. As part of its operating policy, the BOI intervenes in the foreign exchange market in the event of unusual movement in the exchange rate that is inconsistent with underlying economic conditions or when conditions are disorderly. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The BOI publishes its monthly net foreign exchange purchases in a communiqué."
2010,136,Italy,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating.

2010,343,Jamaica,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market, where the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) intervenes frequently. As a result of official actions, the Jamaican dollar has been stable against the U.S. dollar since February 10, 2009, with a one-time step realignment in June 2010. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar. The BOJ publishes information on its foreign exchange market interventions in its Annual Report and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report. The BOJ purchases foreign exchange from ADs and cambios under the following terms: (1) Purchases are made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, and euros. (2) The minimum amount the BOJ will purchase in a single transaction is 50,000 units of a foreign currency. (3) The exchange rates for these currencies are negotiated by the BOJ. The BOJ publishes the amount and the prices of bilateral trade transactions in the interbank foreign exchange market. The BOJ also posts clientsʹ orders on its website."
2010,158,Japan,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the yen is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disorderly conditions in the market. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange interventions fall within the mandate of the MOF, which publishes the daily amount of purchases and sales, as well as intervention currencies, on its website. The Bank of Japan (BOJ), acting as agent of the minister of finance, intervenes in the market through financial institutions and/or brokers. For the first time since 2004, the MOF intervened in the foreign exchange market on September 15, 2010. Subsequently, on March 18, 2011, in the extraordinary circumstances following the earthquake and tsunami, the Ministry of Finance, in coordination with other G-7 countries, intervened in the foreign exchange market."
2010,439,Jordan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dinar is officially pegged to the SDR, but in practice, it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since late 1995."
2010,916,Kazakhstan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float, effective February 28, 2011 (previously, a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands). The main intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Intervention in the foreign exchange market seeks to smooth out demand and supply for the purpose of implementing monetary policy and is based on advice from the NBK Monetary Policy Technical Committee. The NBK may conduct foreign exchange operations both on the regulated (Kazakhstan Stock Exchange—KASE) and on the interbank (OTC) foreign exchange markets. Interventions may take place both on the exchange and on the interbank markets with or without market makers. Second-tier banksʹ demand for or supply of foreign exchange triggers intervention in the foreign exchange market. The NBK intervenes directly with market participants at their quoted rates and does not publish data on its interventions. On February 4, 2009, the tenge was devalued by 18%, and in accordance with the NBKʹs announcement, a trading band was established vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar at ±3%. Effective February 1, 2010, the tenge trading band was widened asymmetrically to a range between +10% and –15% of T 150 per U.S. dollar. The trading band was abandoned, effective February 25, 2011, and a transition to a managed floating regime was announced on February 28, 2011. Since October 2009, the tenge has has consistently tracked a trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2010,664,Kenya,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. Official foreign exchange market interventions aim to moderate the rate of change and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than to establish a particular level. Data on interventions are only partially disclosed. If the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) uses the auction system to intervene, the market is informed of the amount dealt and the average rate (the average rate is published after the auction closes). If the CBK chooses to intervene directly (i.e., by buying or selling foreign exchange from or to banks directly through the Reuters dealing system), the markets are informed but amounts and rates are not published."

2010,446,Lebanon,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is free floating. In practice, the exchange rate remains within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Banque du Liban (BDL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market daily from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and from 10:00 a.m. until noon on Friday. The BDL does not publish intervention data."

2010,676,Malawi,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Official intervention focuses on meeting the target on the net foreign reserves position and limiting exchange rate volatility and takes into account seasonal fluctuations. However, on December 2, 2009, Malawi officially announced that it had adopted a floating exchange rate, and the kwacha gradually depreciated for a short time. The kwacha then stabilized in a 2% band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Thus, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective February 1, 2010. The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) is a large supplier of foreign exchange in the foreign exchange market and is therefore able to significantly influence the official rates."
2010,548,Malaysia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) operates a de jure managed float for the ringgit with reference to a currency basket. The composition of the basket is not disclosed. As a result of the ringgit tracking a composite, although not closely enough to be classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BNM does not publish its intervention data. The BNM may transact directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers at the rates it deems fit for the purpose of maintaining orderly market conditions without targeting any particular exchange rate level."
2010,556,Maldives,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Effective April 11, 2011, the Maldives government adopted a new exchange rate regime under which the Maldivian rufiyaa (MRF) will float in a band of 20% in either direction around a central parity of MRF 12.85 per U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Previously, it was a conventional pegged arrangement, with the rufiyaa pegged to the U.S. dollar at a buying rate of Rf 12.75 per U.S. dollar and a selling rate of Rf 12.85 per U.S. dollar. After the adoption of pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands on April 11, 2011, the rufiyaa-U.S. dollar exchange rate hasnʹt diverged from its past pattern through April 30, 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized arrangement from conventional peg, effective April 11, 2011."
2010,678,Mali,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Mali participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."

The ouguiya was previously de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar, at an exchange rate of UM 268.6 per U.S. dollar. The new foreign exchange market uses a fixing system in which the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) intervenes. The BCM intervenes in order to regulate the exchange market according to its exchange rate policy objectives (smoothing the exchange rate) and the projected level of official reserves. Due to authoritiesʹ control over the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. A summary statement of BCM intervention data is updated daily on the BCM website."

The Bank of Mauritius (BOM) states that intervention in the foreign exchange market is limited to smoothing operations and does not aim to offset market forces. After a period of no intervention between December 2008 and June 2010, the BOM started intervening again in the foreign exchange market in July 2010. As a result, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from free floating, effective July 1, 2010. Information regarding interventions is published regularly on the BOM website and in its publications."
2010,273,Mexico,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the peso is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Mexico (BOM) has an intervention mechanism based on put options, which entail the right of the buyer to sell U.S. dollars when the exchange rate appreciates more than its 20-day moving average, with BOM foreign exchange purchases still subject to the discretion of the option holders—who may choose to wait before exercising the option. The BOM sold put options for US$600 million each month from February 2010 through April 30, 2011, and the BOM bought foreign exchange amounting to US$6.68 billion from option holders who exercised the options 42 times during the same period. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The auction with a minimum price auction mechanism was suspended, effective April 13, 2010, and has not been reinstated. The BOM reserves the right to make extraordinary sales of foreign exchange if necessary due to market conditions."

Sharp exchange rate fluctuations are not specifically defined; however, the NBM intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market based on market conditions and future expectations of market participants. These interventions do not aim to change the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM intervenes directly at the market quoted rates and publishes aggregated monthly data regarding its interventions and the interbank market turnover on its website. The data show interventions by currency and type of operation (spot or derivative)."
2010,948,Mongolia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating.

The exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may intervene if the exchange rate is exceptionally high or low, if that rate is not justified by economic fundamentals, and if there is a material prospect that the intervention will influence the exchange rate. Interventions may not be used as an attempt to influence the long-term trend of the exchange rate. As a result, RBNZ interventions are very rare. The RBNZ publishes information on its foreign currency intervention capacity (stock of reserves available for foreign exchange intervention) and foreign exchange swap position on its website but does not publish data on its direct intervention. The RBNZ has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since June 2007."

2010,694,Nigeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The CBN explicitly aims to maintain an exchange rate principally driven by market forces but intervenes to reduce volatility and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. The de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified as other managed arrangement because of the frequent changes in policy over the past two years. The CBN publishes information on its interventions through auction on its website; however, data on interventions in the interbank market are not disseminated. Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15% around the central rate. The CBN has not implemented this regime."
2010,142,Norway,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the krone floats freely and independently against other currencies. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Norges Bank (NB) does not normally intervene to influence the exchange rate of the krone; however, it may intervene in the foreign exchange market on short notice if the krone deviates substantially from the level the NB considers reasonable in relation to fundamentals and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target. The NB may also intervene in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level. The NB has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999. Foreign exchange purchases for the Government Pension Fund Global are publicly preannounced on the CB website. In extraordinary circumstances, the NB may provide foreign exchange liquidity via collateralized operations. This was done during September 2008–July 2009."

2010,564,Pakistan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating with no predetermined path. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) does not make any explicit or implicit commitment with respect to an exchange rate target or path. The SBP intervenes in the foreign exchange market; however, since December 2009, market interventions have been directed toward rebuilding foreign exchange reserves at the SBP, a key objective of the authoritiesʹ economic program that is supported by an IMF stand-by arrangement. The rupee closely followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band from December 2008 through February 2010. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement from floating, effective December 22, 2008. In early March 2010, the rupee started to appreciate, leaving the crawling band, before weakening back to its previous level by May 31, 2010. Due to increased flexibility of the exchange rate during this period, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from a crawl-like arrangement, effective March 1, 2010. Since June 2010, the rupee has remained stable against the U.S. dollar in a 2% band. Market supply and demand play a role in determining the exchange rate, as does official action based on the observed path of the exchange rate and information on intervention and reserves buildup. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar from floating, effective June 1, 2010. The SBP does not publish information regarding its interventions."

2010,283,Panama,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an arrangement with no separate legal tender. The balboa is pegged to the U.S. dollar at par.
2010,853,Papua New-Guinea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the kina is determined in the interbank market, in which ADs participate. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth extreme fluctuations without setting an acceptable range of daily volatility; however, it does not publish information on its interventions."
2010,288,Paraguay,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; the exchange rate of the guaraní is determined by supply and demand. The Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) intervenes in the exchange market to smooth the effects of undue fluctuations. The objective of the CBP under Article 3 of its Organic Law (No. 489/95) is to preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Moreover, Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the CBP aims to smooth seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. Article 47 establishes that the exchange rate is determined by market forces. The CBP publishes information on its foreign exchange interventions. Given the focus of the monetary authorities on exchange rate stability, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2010,293,Peru,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the nuevo sol is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) is authorized by law to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The stated goal of these interventions is to limit foreign exchange volatility without altering the exchange rateʹs primary trend. Intervention may also be conducted using bonds indexed to the exchange rate and repos. The BCRP publishes information regarding its interventions (prices and amounts) on its website on a daily basis. From September 2009 through March 2011, the nuevo sol tracked an appreciating trend vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. During this period, the BCRP intervened in the foreign exchange market, which resulted in the nuevo sol consistently remaining within a 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement from floating, effective September 16, 2009. Due to the increased flexibility in the nuevo sol–U.S. dollar exchange rate since the beginning of April 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a crawl-like arrangement, effective April 1, 2011."
2010,566,Philippines,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) adheres to a market-determined exchange rate policy with some scope for occasional action solely to prevent sharp fluctuations that could be disruptive. This means that the BSP does not target or support a given level of exchange rate; instead, it allows the value of the peso to be determined by the supply and demand of foreign exchange. The BSP may participate in the U.S. dollar–peso market directly with market participants or via market makers and does not disclose intervention data, which are for internal use only. However, data on currency swaps settled in foreign currency and nondeliverable forwards settled in domestic currency are reported monthly in Sections II and IV, respectively, of the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which is posted on the BSP website on a monthly basis."
2010,964,Poland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the zloty is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, and the zloty is traded freely against all currencies. The National Bank of Poland (NBP), however, reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market, should such intervention be necessary to ensure domestic macroeconomic and financial stability, which is conducive to meeting the inflation target in the medium term. The NBP has intervened once during the past 10 years, on April 9, 2010, and the intervention was followed by a communiqué from the NBP. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. The NBP has not intervened since April 2010."
2010,182,Portugal,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Portugal participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2011, 16 other EU member countries (previously, 15; now including Estonia) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; however, it has not intervened since 2000. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2010,453,Qatar,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The targeted peg was officially authorized by Amiri Decree No. 34 of 2001 issued in July 2001, replacing the de jure exchange rate policy of pegging to the SDR, which had been in effect since 1975. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) does not publish data on its interventions."
2010,634,Republic of Congo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. The Republic of Congo participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CAEMC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (“Joint Monetary Committee”) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to renounce the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of any member country from the BEAC automatically results in that member countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2010,819,Republic of Fiji,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) does not publish intervention data. The power to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is provided in the Reserve Bank of Fiji Act. A change in the exchange rate arrangement may be proposed by the RBF and approved by the minister of finance.
2010,542,Republic of Korea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the won is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. As such, the system is managed in accordance with the principles defined by the free floating system, and the governmentʹs role is very limited, being within the range allowed by the free floating system. However, because of the lack of information on the authoritiesʹ intervention, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Korea (BOK) may intervene in the market with the funds of the BOK and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund when it is deemed necessary for the stability of the market. Interventions in the spot market or through derivatives in the forward market are not announced, and intervention data are not published."
2010,474,Republic of Yemen,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been free floating since July 1996. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) receives most of the foreign exchange proceeds of the country, particularly crude oil export revenues, official loans, and official development assistance. Faced with falling reserves, on June 1, 2009, the CBY reverted from an open window on foreign exchange sales (at a steady rate of about Yrls 200 per U.S. dollar) to periodic auctions, which allowed some depreciation of the rial. After a gradual depreciation of 9% against the U.S. dollar during the first half of 2010, the rial experienced a further drop of more than 6% in July alone followed by a rapid appreciation of 10% in August. From September 2010 through mid-February 2011, the exchange rate remained stable in the region of 214 to 215 rial per U.S. dollar, mainly in the context of recent CBY measures mitigating speculative activity in the foreign exchange market and the CBYʹs policy of providing banks with foreign exchange to finance imports of essential commodities. In February 2011, the foreign exchange market was disrupted and remains uncertain, with no discernible pattern for the rial. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2010,968,Romania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) may intervene to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations. There is no formal definition of excessive exchange rate fluctuations: the assessment is based on domestic and international market circumstances and on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The NBR intervenes either directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers. The NBR does not publish information on its interventions. The NBR has the authority to change the exchange rate arrangement.
2010,922,Russian Federation,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement—namely a controlled floating exchange rate arrangement. The ruble value of a bi-currency basket is used as the operating benchmark for transactions on the domestic foreign exchange market. The bi-currency basket, including the U.S. dollar and the euro, has been used by the Bank of Russia (BR) as an operating benchmark for currency interventions since 2005. Initially, the composition of the bi-currency basket was €0.10 and US$0.90, but as the participants of the domestic foreign exchange market adapted to the new conditions, the BR revised its composition, increasing the euro share. The basket now is composed of €0.45 and US$0.55. The BR establishes an operational floating range of its allowable levels with automatic revisions of boundaries depending on the volume of currency interventions. The value of the bi-currency basket is determined under the influence of both market factors and exchange interventions by the BR. Interventions take place both on boundaries and within bands. In addition to interventions, which are aimed at limiting the volatility of the ruble exchange rate, the BR carries out targeted interventions to offset the effect of the systematic mismatch of demand and supply of foreign currency in the domestic market. The parameters of targeted interventions are determined taking into account fundamental external factors governing formation of the balance of payments. When the volume of BR transactions completed within and at the boundaries of an operating band exceeds the targeted interventions for an established level, the bandʹs boundaries are revised. The BR implemented the following changes in currency policy: (1) It widened the band of allowable fluctuations from Rub 3 to Rub 4, effective October 13, 2010, and from Rub 4 to Rub 5, effective March 1, 2011. (2) It reduced the size of the accumulated interventions on the bandʹs edge by 5 kopeks from US$700 million to US$650 million, effective October 13, 2010, and from US$650 to US$600 million, effective March 1, 2011. (3) Effective October 13, 2010, it eliminated the fixed currency band of Rub 26–41 for the dual-currency basket, in effect since January 2009. Due to the continued control of the BR over exchange rate determination, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BR intervenes both on interbank currency exchanges and on the OTC interbank market to smooth out daily fluctuations. Since August 2008, the BR has published its volume of interventions on a monthly basis. These data are presented within seven days of the end of the reporting period."
2010,714,Rwanda,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) sells francs at a predetermined reference price to market participants and the government. Since January 2010, the franc has gradually depreciated against the U.S. dollar in a 2% band. Therefore, effective January 4, 2010, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement from a stabilized arrangement."
2010,862,Samoa,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) does not publish data on its interventions. Currently, there is no legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement, except the CBS Act of 1984, which states only that the CBS is responsible for setting the exchange rate."
2010,135,San Marino,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. San Marino has a monetary agreement with Italy, on behalf of the EU, that went into effect April 1, 2001, and (1) establishes that euro coins and banknotes are legal tender in San Marino; and (2) gives San Marino the authority to issue a certain number of euro coins, which are legal tender in the euro area and are equivalent in form to euro area coinage."
2010,716,São Tomé and Príncipe,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. Beginning February 1, 2009, the focus of the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) switched from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which became the new reference currency for managing the exchange rate. The BCSTP scaled back its intervention in the foreign exchange market to build up reserves before the planned adoption of a formal peg to the euro in 2010. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a conventional peg to the euro from other managed arrangement, effective January 5, 2010. The organic law of the CB authorizes it to make decisions regarding exchange rate policy."
2010,456,Saudi Arabia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The GCC Supreme Economic Council adopted the U.S. dollar as a nominal anchor on December 31, 2001, with an effective date of January 1, 2003. The rate of the riyal against the U.S. dollar is determined by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) and has been stable since June 1986. The SAMA, in coordination with the minister of finance, decides on changes in the exchange rate arrangement. Historically, the SAMA has not published its intervention data."
2010,722,Senegal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Senegal participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2010,942,Serbia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, according to the Decision on the Dinar Exchange Rate Regime. Since the introduction of this exchange rate regime in 2001 and in accordance with its commitment regarding the liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the National bank of Serbia (NBS) has been striving to reduce its participation in the foreign exchange market and to adjust the features of the existing exchange rate regime—managed floating—in the direction of soft managed floating so as to pave the way for the freely floating exchange rate regime as a prerequisite for the adoption of inflation targeting. This exchange rate regime enables the NBS to balance, when necessary, foreign exchange demand and supply, as well as to moderate excessive daily fluctuations of the exchange rate in either direction (appreciation or depreciation) that may occur under the influence of external or internal shocks on the national economy. The NBS interventions do not aim to achieve a certain level of the exchange rate. In different stages of the development of the exchange rate arrangement, the NBS is implementing its foreign exchange interventions in different ways. From the introduction of the managed floating exchange rate regime to June 2007, the NBS implemented its foreign exchange interventions by organizing fixing sessions every working day (in the first years of the implementation of the existing exchange rate regime, it had features of a hard managed regime). In the quiet and stable political and economic period, from June 2007 onward, the NBS started to intervene only when necessary, by selling and purchasing foreign exchange at the best quoted rate, as the price taker through Reuters Dealing System—a period of a very soft managed floating exchange rate regime (long periods without interventions). In 2009 the NBS introduced the possibility of intervening at the interbank foreign exchange market by organizing auction sales and purchases of foreign exchange. In accordance with Inflation Targeting as Monetary Strategy (as of January 1, 2009), foreign exchange interventions are an infrequent secondary instrument used to support the achievement of the inflation target only after the potential for influencing inflation effectively through changing the key policy rate is exhausted. Interventions in the foreign exchange market take place only to moderate excessive daily fluctuations of the exchange rate of the dinar, in either direction (appreciation or depreciation), in order to contain threats to financial and price stability. Despite the NBS commitment regarding the foreign exchange market liberalization, in 2010, the NBS intervened substantially, mostly selling foreign exchange (selling €2,570 million and purchasing €237 million). The NBS has increased its activity (quite notably on some days) in order to encourage trading and boost market liquidity in unstable foreign exchange market conditions with insufficient interbank trade volume caused by domestic instability and the global financial crisis. During 2010, the NBS intervened through €2,333 million in net sales in order to moderate excessive daily fluctuations of the exchange rate and to slow the depreciation of national currency in the unstable foreign exchange market conditions. Increased demand for foreign currency and strong depreciation pressures were generated by elevated risk premiums, markedly low capital inflows from FDI and bank and enterprise external debt repayment. The increase in risk premiums began in early May due to investorsʹ negative perception about fallout from the Greece crisis and its spillover to the rest of the region, as well as due to economic tensions in the euro area and concerns over the financial health of central and eastern European countries. Publication of intervention data can be found at www.nbs.rs/static/nbs_site/gen/latinica/90/statisticki/SBEOI07.xls."
2010,718,Seychelles,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by demand and supply in the market, with the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) intervening only to smooth exchange rate volatility and manage liquidity. Operational guidelines specify the role of the CBS as the buyer/seller of last resort in the foreign exchange market. The CBS discloses intervention data on its website, which is publicly accessible."
2010,724,Sierra Leone,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, with the exchange rate of the leone determined by the market. The auction rate is used as a reference rate by market participants, but the auction constitutes only about 7% of official foreign exchange transactions. There is no policy aimed at targeting a specific level of the exchange rate. Occasionally, the BSL buys or sells foreign exchange directly with banks. The Bank of Sierra Leone buys foreign exchange from the market to build up its reserves and sells to the market through the foreign exchange auction. The BSL publishes its weekly foreign exchange amount offered for sale and the result of the weekly foreign exchange auction on its website."
2010,576,Singapore,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The authorities manage the exchange rate as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the objective of maintaining price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. The Singapore dollar is allowed to fluctuate within a targeted policy band and is managed against a basket of currencies of the countryʹs major trading partners and competitors. Currencies in the basket are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the countries in Singaporeʹs trade relations with the world. The exchange rate policy is announced every six months in the Monetary Policy Statement, typically in terms of changes to the slope, central rate, and width of the policy band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) intervenes through agents and does not publish information on its interventions."
2010,936,Slovak Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating.

2010,813,Solomon Islands,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The exchange rate of the Solomon Islands dollar is calculated on the basis of a basket of foreign currency but further managed by the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) through interventions on a daily basis to determine its value vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. At the beginning of June 2008, the Solomon Islands dollar began to depreciate, leaving the peg, before stabilizing around a new level by end-March, 2009. Because there was no discernible pattern during this period, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as other managed. From April 2009 through January 2011, the Solomon Islands dollar remained pegged to the U.S. dollar at SI$8.06 per U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to a conventional peg from other managed arrangement, effective April 1, 2009. Even though the method of exchange rate calculation has not changed, the currency composition and weights of the basket, determined on the basis of the volume and direction of the countryʹs trade, have been updated, effective February 1, 2011. The exchange rate regime of pegging the Solomon Islands dollar to a basket of currency remains unchanged. After implementation of the updated basket in February 2011, the Solomon Islands dollar began to appreciate and move more freely against the U.S. dollar. Due to the increased flexibility, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a conventional peg, effective February 1, 2011. The CBSI determines the exchange rate of the Solomon Islands dollar against the U.S. dollar with a mandatory spread. The CBSI publishes for commercial banks the U.S. dollar/Solomon Islands dollar buying and selling rates and the mandatory spread limits. Under the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands Act, the CBSI may change the exchange rate arrangement only on written instructions from the minister of finance."

2010,199,South Africa,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the rand is determined by demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has a publicly announced policy of purchasing foreign currency in the foreign exchange market from time to time, when market conditions permit, with the aim of gradually building up its foreign reserves without seeking to influence the level of the exchange rate. The SARB interacts with ADs as the price taker for official and commercial purposes. However, the SARB does not sell foreign exchange to ADs. The market makers and brokers quote prices to other market participants; the SARB does not quote prices for market participants. The SARB does not publish information on its interventions, but it publishes a monthly release on its official gold and foreign exchange reserves."

The CBSL intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the exchange rate. During 2010, despite increased capital inflows, a very stable exchange rate was maintained and the rupee has gradually appreciated (at an annualized rate of 3.35%) against the U.S. dollar within a narrow band since March 2010. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement against the U.S. dollar from a stabilized arrangement, effective March 1, 2010. The CBSL publishes intervention data on its website and in its annual report."
2010,361,St. Kitts and Nevis,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Kitts and Nevis participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender.

2010,732,Sudan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The exchange rate is determined in the interbank market, in which participants deal directly with each other. The Central Bank of Sudan (CBOS) participates in the market through swaps under a rules-based mechanism that triggers intervention if the exchange rate exceeds a band of ±3% around the previous dayʹs closing rate. The main objective of the policy is to achieve exchange rate stability. Given the focus of the CBOS on exchange rate stability and in line with recent exchange rate movements, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to other managed arrangement from floating, effective December 1, 2009. The CBOS does not disclose information on its interventions to the public."
2010,366,Suriname,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"According to a July 1994 presidential decree, the exchange rate is to be determined based on demand and supply of foreign exchange. The exchange rate of the Surinamese dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official and parallel markets remained stable at about SRD 2.75 per U.S. dollar until January 20, 2011. On January 20, 2011, the authorities devalued the currency by 20% to SRD 3.3 per U.S. dollar and set a band of SRD 3.25–3.35 per U.S. dollar, within which all official and commercial market transactions are allowed to take place. However, the SRD-USD exchange rate remained in a narrower band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. In the event of a persistent discrepancy between the official rate and the rates quoted by commercial banks and nonbank institutions, the official exchange rate is adjusted to reflect the prevailing market conditions."
2010,734,Swaziland,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The Central Bank of Swaziland Order, 1974 is the legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement."

The exchange rate of the krona is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are allowed under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., participation in concerted interventions with other CBs). Sveriges Riksbank (SR) announces its intervention in a press communiqué, explains the motive, and discloses the framework of intervention. However, no intervention has been reported since June 14, 2001."

However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free market rates. The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual accountability report. The SNB interventions in the foreign exchange market lasted through May 2010 and it has not intervened since.

However, the pound has shown limited volatility against a composite including the SDR basket of currencies (euro, pound sterling, U.S. dollar, and Japanese yen), although the U.S. dollar has a larger weight than in the SDR basket. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite."
2010,923,Tajikistan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The exchange rate of the somoni is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, in which the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) may intervene to limit exchange rate volatility. The NBT presents information on the volume of its purchase and sale transactions in foreign exchange on a quarterly basis. As a result of monetary measures and foreign exchange interventions by the authorities starting in July 2009, the exchange rate of the somoni has stabilized. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar."
2010,738,Tanzania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bank of Tanzania (BOT) is the predominant supplier of foreign exchange in a rather shallow market. It has been almost exclusively on the selling side in the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM), in order to sterilize liquidity generated by government spending financed by official inflows. The amount of the BOTʹs foreign exchange sales has varied to avoid disruptive exchange rate fluctuations. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The BOT, on a monthly basis, informs market participants of the amount to be sold in the market. Information on BOT intervention is announced to market participants through the Reuters system. Under this system, commercial banks submit two-way quotes (bid and ask) in the IFEM."
2010,578,Thailand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Under the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the value of the baht is allowed to be determined by market forces, reflecting demand and supply for the baht in the foreign exchange market. However, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) will curb any excessive volatility in the value of the baht that could adversely impact national competitiveness. The BOT does not disclose information on its interventions."
2010,313,The Bahamas,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement.
2010,648,The Gambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the dalasi is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Gambia participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the dalasi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15% around the central rate. However, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures. The Central Bank of the Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange. Such intervention aims to augment international reserves or reduce volatility in exchange rate movements."
2010,537,Timor-Leste,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely.
2010,742,Togo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Togo participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2010,866,Tonga,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. The external value of the paʹanga is determined on the basis of a weighted currency basket comprising the Australian dollar, Japanese yen, New Zealand dollar, and U.S. dollar. The basket weights are determined based on the proportions of trade with trading partners. The weights are not published. The exchange rate of the paʹanga in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) within a band of ±5%. The NRBT does not publish intervention data. Under Section 34 of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (Amendment) Act 2007, the external value of the paʹanga is determined from time to time in a manner approved by the NRBT board, after consultation with the minister of finance, having due regard for the obligations Tonga has assumed in accordance with the provisions of any international monetary agreement to which it is a party or to which it adheres. Section 35(1) of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act empowers the NRBT to set the exchange rate."
2010,369,Trinidad and Tobago,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Because the Trinidad and Tobago dollar has remained stable against the U.S. dollar, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is a stabilized arrangement. The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) does not publish its intervention data."
2010,744,Tunisia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the dinar is determined in the interbank market. The Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to regulate foreign exchange demand and supply and publishes daily an indicative interbank exchange rate for the dinar against the main international foreign currencies. Since January 2009, the dinar has been very stable against a euro–U.S. dollar composite. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite. The CBT intervenes in the foreign exchange market in response to requests from banks for quotes. The rates posted by the CBT reflect the exchange rates prevailing in the international foreign exchange market. Effective January 1, 2011, the CBT posts the volume of transactions between authorized intermediaries (IATs) and the volume of its daily interventions in the interbank foreign exchange market on its website. Previously, the CBT did not release intervention data to the public."
2010,186,Turkey,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lira is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market in case of unstable price movements in exchange rates. When the CBRT intervenes in the market, it may either buy or sell foreign exchange from the rates quoted by the banks directly or may intervene through an auction. The CBRT announced the general framework of the monetary and exchange rate policies envisaged for 2011 in a press release titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2011” of December 21, 2010. Having a strong foreign exchange reserve position was stated as the general strategy of the CBRT. Effective August 3, 2010, in order to accelerate the foreign exchange reserve accumulation, the CBRT increased the maximum daily amount to be purchased in auctions to US$80 million from US$60 million, composed of US$40 million (previously, US$30 million) of auction amount and US$40 million (previously, US$30 million) of maximum optional selling amount granted to successful bidders. Effective October 4, 2010, the CBRT altered the method of foreign exchange buying auctions, while keeping the regular auction amount at US$80 million daily, as follows: (1) The CBRT may raise the maximum daily amount to be purchased, with the maximum additional amount for a given week is posted on Reuters page CBTQ at 11:00 a.m. on the first working day of the respective week, (2) The portion of the weekly preannounced amount that may be purchased within a given day is posted on Reuters page CBTQ at 1:30 p.m., along with the regular daily auction amount, (3) On days when the CBRT makes additional purchases, successful bidders may not sell an optional amount. Effective October 4, 2010, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from free floating because of the discretionary nature of the modified auction system and its impact on the exchange rate. The CBRT publishes the results of its daily auctions on its website. When the CBRT intervenes in the market, it may either buy or sell foreign exchange directly at the rates quoted by the banks or may intervene through an auction."
2010,925,Turkmenistan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT) is fully responsible for exchange rate policy.

2010,746,Uganda,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The authorities intervene in Ugandaʹs foreign exchange market when short-term fluctuations jeopardize its orderly operation. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) publishes information on its interventions in regular reports. The BOU intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market at the banksʹ quoted rates, using the best bid-ask principle. Since November 2009, the BOU has reduced the amount of its daily foreign exchange intervention (for sterilization under the monetary program) from US$ 0.3 million to US$0.1 million. Effective August 19, 2010, the BOU shifted from daily sales to daily purchases of US$0.5 million for reserve buildup purposes."
2010,926,Ukraine,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Effective October 19, 2010, pursuant to the amendments to the Law of Ukraine on the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the NBUʹs primary function is to ensure the stability of the national currency, with high priority on achieving and maintaining price stability. In line with this, the NBU is shifting its efforts toward developing a more robust monetary policy framework focused on domestic price stability with greater exchange rate flexibility. Pursuant to the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policy, and in the framework of the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF, the NBU has increased the flexibility of the hryvnia exchange rate. In addition, a transition to a free floating exchange rate is planned as the financial system recovers and the transmission mechanisms mature. Nonetheless, the NBU has continued to influence the exchange rate without announcing a specific path or exchange rate target by intervening in the interbank market. During foreign exchange sale interventions, the NBU satisfies all the demand at its quoted rate. The NBU intervenes both in U.S. dollars and in euros, although the euro amounts are quite marginal. Since March 2010, the hryvnia has been stable against the U.S. dollar in a tight 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar from other managed arrangement, effective March 1, 2010. The NBU publishes information about its foreign exchange market interventions on its website."
2010,466,United Arab Emirates,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dirham was officially pegged to the U.S. dollar in January 2003. The United Arab Emirates Central Bank (UAECB) does not publish its intervention data.
2010,112,United Kingdom,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the pound sterling is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of England (BOE) has a separate pool of foreign exchange reserves, which it may use at its discretion to intervene in support of its monetary policy objectives. A monthly press release issued by Her Majestyʹs Treasury (HMT) reports HMT and BOE intervention."
2010,111,United States,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are not formally ruled out in the United States, but they are rarely used. The secretary of the treasury is responsible for the formulation and implementation of international monetary and financial policy, including exchange market intervention policy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has separate legal authority to engage in foreign exchange operations. The Fedʹs foreign exchange operations are conducted in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury to ensure consistency with U.S. international monetary and financial policy. The Treasury and the Fed have closely coordinated their foreign exchange operations since early 1962, when the Fed commenced such operations at the request of the Treasury. Operations are conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as fiscal agent of the United States and as the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. Interventions are reported in the Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations quarterly bulletin. There were no interventions during 2010. If the U.S. monetary authorities were to intervene in the foreign exchange market, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York would conduct the operations at prevailing market prices and generally would execute the transactions by means of electronic brokerage systems using market makers in the OTC market."
2010,298,Uruguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the peso is determined on the basis of supply and demand, although the CBU reserves the right to intervene to cushion abrupt changes in a concentrated market of few transactions. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The CBU publishes information on intervention on its website."
2010,927,Uzbekistan,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. Since 2001, the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar has been determined by interbank trading sessions (ITS). Since March 2008, ITS include euro operations. The sum has gradually depreciated against the U.S. dollar."
2010,846,Vanuatu,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Officially, the external value of the vatu is determined on the basis of an undisclosed transaction-weighted basket of currencies of Vanuatuʹs major trading and tourism partners, including the Australian dollar, the euro, the New Zealand dollar, the U.S. dollar, and the yen. In practice, the vatu has experienced slightly more volatility against a composite than the 2% band typical of stabilized or pegged arrangements. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2010,299,Venezuela,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The bolívar is pegged to the U.S. dollar. On January 1, 2008, a monetary reconversion process eliminated three zeros from the national currency. As a result, the bolívar–U.S. dollar exchange rate was expressed as Bs 2.14 (buying) and Bs 2.15 (selling) per U.S. dollar. Effective January 11, 2010, Venezuela devalued its currency from Bs 2.15 per U.S. dollar to Bs 4.30 per U.S. dollar for most imports, while setting a second rate of Bs 2.60 per U.S. dollar for imports of food, medicine, and machinery (priority goods). Effective January 1, 2011, the CBV unified the exchange rate at Bs 4.30 per U.S. dollar. Effective June 4, 2010, the parallel market has been abolished and replaced with SITME, a bond swap mechanism operated by the CBV. The implicit rate at the bond swap market was established at Bs 5.30 per U.S. dollar by the CBV beginning June 9, 2010, the first day of transactions in the SITME."
2010,582,Vietnam,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) announces the daily average interbank exchange rate against the U.S. dollar; authorized credit institutions (CIs) base their bid and offer quotes on this rate. The official exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange supply and demand in the market. There is no preannounced path for the central rate. On November 26, 2009, the SBV reverted to its previous policy of a ±3% U.S. dollar–dong trading band around the rate quoted by the SBV with a one-step devaluation of about 5½% in the central rate. In 2010, the official exchange rate quoted by the SBV was adjusted two times: February 11 and August 18. Effective February 11, 2010, the SBV devalued the dong by 8.5% against the U.S. dollar and narrowed the band to ±1%. Effective August 18, 2010, the SBV devalued the dong by 2% against the U.S. dollar. In the interbank market, the dong–U.S. dollar exchange rate was at the ceiling of the band from September 2010 to March 2011. Since early March 2011, interbank rates have fallen to lower and more comfortable levels. The SBV does not release its intervention data."
2010,754,Zambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is floating. The official exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) intervenes in the market primarily through transactions with ADs, which are all registered commercial banks. BOZ interventions in the market are published as historical data, and its foreign exchange transactions are published in the fortnightly statistics."
2010,698,Zimbabwe,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The use of the Zimbabwe dollar as domestic currency has been discontinued for economic, financial, and administrative purposes over the period 2011–12. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender from other managed arrangement, effective January 1, 2010."
2011,512,Afghanistan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement is a managed floating exchange rate regime. The DAB intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market in the form of twice-weekly selling auctions, and the results are published on the DAB website. The DAB deals with ADs only through the auction. The primary goal of these auctions is to control the growth of reserve money and/or currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction exchange rate volatility. The Afghani remained stable against the U.S. dollar between September 2010 and March 31, 2011, during which time the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a stabilized arrangement. Due to the increased flexibility in the Afghani–U.S. dollar exchange rate since the beginning of April 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement, effective April 1, 2011."
2011,914,Albania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lek is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) is not usually active in this market. In accordance with its regulations, intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) Severe and adverse movement in the exchange rate of the lek: These are cases of excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market and are considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementation of Monetary Policy, which seeks to avoid intervening in the market. However, lack of depth in the market and pronounced seasonal factors (i.e., seasonal increases in the supply of foreign currency in the summer months and in December and stronger imports during the first part of the year) can result in fast one-way movement, which may disrupt activity in the domestic foreign exchange market. The bid-ask spreads may widen up to 1%, and at times banks do not deal with each other at all. In such circumstances, intervention may be used to restore calm to a disorderly market and to smooth the seasonal trends. (2) Considerable exchange rate misalignment with fundamentals: The lek is considered misaligned with fundamentals if there is a lengthy overshooting of the exchange rate. (3) Effective January 16, 2012, a need to accumulate an adequate level of foreign reserves in the medium term in order to cover more than four months of imports and the short-term external debt of the country. (Previously, the BOA intervened in order to meet the net international reserves target, which was included each year in its monetary program.) When the BOA intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange markets, its counterparties are the commercial banks, but when necessary, the BOA may carry out its interventions with foreign exchange bureaus. The BOA conducts interventions through (1) verbal interventions, in the form of press releases in the print or electronic media and/or press conferences; and (2) transactional interventions. The intervention exchange rate is determined by commercial banksʹ quotes and the BOA Monetary Operations Departmentʹs quotes. When the intervention exchange rate is uniform for all counterparties, the BOA publishes that rate on its Reuters page and, at the same time, communicates the exchange rate to the commercial banks that do not participate in the Reuters system and to the foreign exchange bureaus with which it has contact. When different exchange rates are used, the BOA announces only the fact that it has intervened; it publishes with a three-month lag the amount of the intervention in a quarterly bulletin that summarizes its foreign exchange operations with banks and the public sector. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2011,612,Algeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Bank of Algeria (BA) does not announce the path of the exchange rate. The external value of the dinar is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the BA is the main seller because of significant inflows related to commodity exports, including hydrocarbons, which, under current law, must be surrendered to the BA. The BA manages the dinar with reference to a basket of currencies, and the rate of the dinar relative to the currencies in the basket is based on balance of payments data. The BA has not set a target range for fluctuation of the dinar outside or within any particular band, and the observed exchange rate movements do not confirm any constant weights of the currency composite. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BA does not disclose information about its interventions."
2011,614,Angola,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. However, the BNA intervenes in the foreign exchange market by holding foreign exchange auctions. The BNA receives taxes, in foreign currency, paid by oil companies to the government, and sells this foreign currency exclusively through its foreign exchange auctions. Through these auctions, the BNA influences the exchange rate. Since November 2010, the kwanza has consistently remained within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with a one-time adjustment in September 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective November 1, 2010. The BNA publishes the auctions results and respective reference rate."
2011,311,Antigua and Barbuda,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Antigua and Barbuda participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2011,213,Argentina,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, and the exchange rate of the peso, which is determined in the MULC by supply and demand, is applied to all transactions in foreign exchange and foreign currency banknotes. The Central Bank of Argentina (BCRA) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to carry out its reserve accumulation and management policy, which acts as a stabilizer during temporary changes in conditions. The BCRA makes no explicit or implicit commitment with respect to the exchange rate level or path. BCRA participation in the foreign exchange market was 11.1% in 2011, up from 6.1% in 2010. In 2011, the peso continued to follow a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% margin, with slightly increased depreciation since July 2011. Market supply and demand play a role in determining the exchange rate, as does official action based on the observed path of the rate and intervention in the spot and forward foreign exchange markets. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BCRA publishes its net purchases in a weekly foreign exchange report."
2011,911,Armenia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. Since March 3, 2009, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) has limited its role as a supplier in the foreign exchange market, thus returning to a de facto floating exchange rate regime. This allows the exchange rate to find a level more in line with existing macroeconomic fundamentals. The CBA intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility, which is defined as short-term high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by speculative or trend-following elements rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals, which impose significant costs on the economy. The CBA intervenes only anonymously through the stock exchange, but it may also intervene in the interbank market, which is not anonymous. The CBA publishes weekly intervention data on its website with a one-week lag. Reflecting exchange rate developments, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2011,314,Aruba,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The legal documents that established the fixed exchange rate arrangement are AB 1992 No. GT 6 State Decree for Fixing Parity of the Aruban florin and Notice on Foreign Exchange Transactions 90/A2.
2011,193,Australia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the RBA retains discretionary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The RBA may also vary the way the intervention is conducted; it may enter the interbank foreign exchange market directly through the voice or electronic brokerage markets or use an agent bank. Given the high level of development of the Australian foreign exchange market, interventions have been rare and targeted toward addressing periods of market dysfunction. As a matter of government policy, all wholesale purchases of foreign currency by government agencies are made through the RBA. The RBA manages the flows from purchases on behalf of the government so as to minimize their market impact–—for example, by executing these trades when the market is liquid and, if necessary, breaking up the required purchases into a series of smaller transactions. The current de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. Monthly purchases and sales of foreign exchange are published on the RBA website. Daily data on foreign exchange market interventions are published on the RBA website annually, following the release of the RBA Annual Report."
2011,122,Austria,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Austria participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2011, 16 other members of the EU (previously 15; now including Estonia) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011 while participating in a concerted G7 intervention in foreign exchange markets. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2011,912,Azerbaijan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. The CBA influences the market exchange rate through the official rate and interventions. The CBA intervenes in the market within the intervention corridor determined around the official rate. Following the transition in March 2008 to a euro–U.S. dollar basket peg, the CBA first increased and then reduced the weight of the euro, resulting in a de facto peg against the U.S. dollar. Effective January 20, 2011, the peg against the basket was abandoned and a bilateral peg against the U.S. dollar was implemented, thereby continuing the de facto peg vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. As a result of official actions, the manat has remained stable vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, with a one-time step realignment in June 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The CBA publishes its foreign exchange intervention data in its quarterly reports."
2011,419,Bahrain,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rate is indicated in the Official Gazette of the CBB.
2011,513,Bangladesh,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating since May 31, 2003. Bangladesh Bank (BB) intervenes on a limited basis in the foreign exchange market to contain undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. In 2011, it sold substantial foreign exchange to government-owned commercial banks mainly to facilitate petroleum import payments. With the strong support of official action in the foreign exchange market, the taka followed a depreciating trend in a narrow band until mid-December, with the exception of a short-lived disruption around late August 2011. Against a backdrop of declining foreign exchange reserves, the authorities let the taka depreciate against the U.S. dollar, with the taka departing from the band on December 19, 2011. Since then, direct intervention by BB has been limited, initially allowing the exchange rate to move more freely. However, beginning in mid-February, the exchange rate has again stabilized. Because the exchange rate does not meet the criteria of either a stabilized arrangement (having been de facto pegged for only slightly over two months as of the end of April) or floating (not largely market determined), the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from a crawl-like arrangement, effective December 19, 2011. BB publishes information on its interventions in its periodic publications (e.g., Annual Report)."
2011,316,Barbados,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The minister of finance, after consultation with the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), pegged the Barbados dollar to the U.S. dollar on July 5, 1975, pursuant to the Exchange Control Act and the Central Bank of Barbados Act. Intervention data are published in Economic and Financial Statistics Section H, Table 2."
2011,913,Belarus,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime was reclassified, effective October 20, 2011, from a pegged exchange rate within a horizontal band to a managed floating regime. Pursuant to the Resolution of the Board of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) on the Amendment of Certain Legal Regulatory Acts of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (No. 446 of October 17, 2011), a managed floating regime was established for the rubel beginning on October 20, 2011, whereby the rubel exchange rate is minimally influenced by direct NBRB participation but responds to the demand and supply of foreign currency under the influence of fundamental macroeconomic factors. NBRB currency interventions are narrowly focused and aim exclusively to smooth sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate. The NBRB officially pegged the rubel against a basket of currencies, including the U.S. dollar, euro, and Russian ruble, within a horizontal band beginning on January 2, 2009, although the rubel remained within a 2% band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar from May 2010 through April 2011, during which time the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a stabilized arrangement. Following substantial loss of reserves in the first quarter of 2011, the NBRB ceased its intervention and a heavily depreciated black market exchange rate emerged. The NBRB devalued the official exchange rate on May 24, 2011, but the parallel foreign exchange market continued, giving rise to multiple exchange rates. On October 20, 2011, the NBRB devalued the official rate once more, thereby unifying the official and black market rates at the market rate by introducing a single trading session, abolishing the official exchange rate band, and announcing the introduction of a managed floating regime. Since then, the NBRB has used official intervention only to smooth excessive fluctuation. Before it was abandoned, the exchange rate band was set at ±10% relative to the value of the currency basket and, effective January 1, 2011, the central exchange rate of the band was adjusted to the actual value of the basket, Rbl 1,054.68, established December 31, 2010. Previously, it was Rbl 1,036.27. Effective May 24, 2011, The NBRB devalued the central exchange rate to Rbl 1,810 against the currency basket, widened the exchange rate band from ±10% to ±12%, within which the exchange rate may weaken or strengthen relative to the value of the basket, and reinstated a limit in OTC trading of a 2% deviation from official rubel exchange rates, which was later repealed effective September 14, 2011. Due to the disruption of the foreign exchange market and the emergence of a black market where substantial trading was taking place, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective May 24, 2011. The NBRB does not publish data on its interventions."
2011,124,Belgium,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Belgium participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2011, 16 other members of the EU (previously 15; now including Estonia) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011 while participating in a concerted G7 intervention in foreign exchange markets. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2011,339,Belize,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Belize dollar is officially pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at the rate of BZ$1 per US$0.5, as established by the Central Bank Act. The CB does not publish its intervention data."
2011,638,Benin,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Benin participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2011,514,Bhutan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. Indian rupee banknotes and coins circulate freely in Bhutan. No current legal documents establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement; the ngultrum has been pegged at par to the Indian rupee since the introduction of the ngultrum in 1974. As per the Royal Monetary Authority Act of Bhutan 2010 (Provisions 88 and 89), the Royal Government, on recommendation of the Royal Monetary Authority of Bhutan, can declare the external value of the ngultrum and the RMA will determine the appropriate external value. The RMA does not publish the intervention data."
2011,218,Bolivia,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg to the U.S. dollar, characterized by small adjustments with no advance notification. The Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) determines the floor price on the daily competitive foreign exchange auction (bolsín) in which the financial system participates. The CBB ensures that the rate is consistent with moderate inflation, thus mitigating external and internal inflation pressure, since the exchange rate is still used as a benchmark for the price of nontradable goods, albeit to a decreasing extent. Given a strong external position, between 2006 and October 2008, the CBB allowed the currency to appreciate in line with the improved economic fundamentals. During a period of stability from October 2008 through November 2010, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a stabilized arrangement. In late November 2010, the CBB restarted nominal adjustments in the exchange rate, appreciating the local currency, to reduce inflationary pressures. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a crawling peg from a stabilized arrangement, effective November 29, 2010. The CBB publishes data on its exchange market interventions and foreign exchange purchases and sales in the “Weekly Statistics” section of its website."
2011,963,Bosnia and Herzegovina,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The CB covers base money with its foreign reserves, including currency in circulation and commercial bank deposits. The Law on the Central Bank, adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, guarantees convertibility of the currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are no restrictions on the purchase and sale of foreign exchange. The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) does not publish data on its sales and purchases."
2011,616,Botswana,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The exchange rate of the pula is officially determined with reference to a weighted basket of currencies composed of the SDR and the South African rand. The rate of crawl of the pula is set as the difference between the Bank of Botswanaʹs (BOBʹs) inflation objective and the inflation forecast in major trading partner countries. The rate of crawl is thus determined using a forward-looking approach and is revised on a regular basis. In this approach, the authorities periodically determine the rate of crawl for the subsequent period, such as the next six or twelve months."
2011,223,Brazil,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the real is determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market in which the Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) participates. The CBB deals at rates quoted by participants in the interbank market. The CBB intervenes to smooth out excessive volatility. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Daily intervention data are published weekly on the CBB website.
2011,516,Brunei Darussalam,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD), which replaced the Brunei Currency and Monetary Board (BCMB), effective January 1, 2011, issues Brunei dollars and manages the Currency Fund. All powers, assets, and liabilities of the BCMB were transferred to the AMBD. Under the terms of the Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA), signed in 1967, which remains in effect between the AMBD and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the monetary authorities agreed to the mutual exchange of each otherʹs currency at par without charge. Government authorities and banks must accept each otherʹs currency at par, and the currencies are customary tender in both countries. Excess currency is repatriated regularly, and the cost of repatriation is borne by the currency-issuing authority. The AMBD must ensure that reserves in the Currency Fund cover at least 100% of the currency in circulation. The AMBD publishes data on the reserves used to cover the currency in circulation through the IMF. Previously, this information was published in the BCMBʹs annual reports."
2011,918,Bulgaria,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board arrangement was introduced by the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) of 1997. The national currency was pegged initially to the German mark and subsequently to the euro. The Law on the BNB adopted in 1997 was a conceptually new legal act, introducing the currency board mechanism, and cannot be considered an amendment to the previous law, similarly called the Law on the BNB, which was in effect until 1997 and repealed by the new law. Aggregate data for daily euro/lev turnover between the BNB and local banks are published on Reutersʹ page NBOB3. Yearly aggregates are available in the annual report."

2011,618,Burundi,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Bank of the Republic of Burundi (BRB) publishes data on its Marché des Enchères Symétriques en Devises (MESD) transactions on its website. The Burundi franc exchange rate, which is determined mainly at the BRB auction, depreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar in the first half of 2011 while remaining in the stabilized band. Beginning July 26, 2011, the exchange rate departed from the band and depreciated at an increasingly accelerated rate. The depreciation continued through February 2012, with relatively more flexibility. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective July 26, 2011. Data on BRB interventions are not published. They are part of the information communicated to banks after MESD transactions."
2011,522,Cambodia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. Given the high degree of financial dollarization, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to accommodate demand for riels and maintain exchange rate stability. There were two marginal adjustments in the path of the riel–U.S. dollar exchange rate in 2011, but the riel remained stable. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Detailed intervention data are available only upon request."
2011,622,Cameroon,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. Cameroon participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender.

2011,156,Canada,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, with the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar determined on the basis of supply and demand. However, in accordance with an intervention policy established by the government in close consultation with the Bank of Canada (BOC), the BOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market on behalf of the federal government to counter disruptive short-term movements in the exchange rate, if necessary. Canadaʹs current policy is to intervene in foreign exchange markets on a discretionary, rather than a systematic, basis and only in the most exceptional circumstances. In March 2011 the BOC joined authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan in a concerted intervention to stabilize the Japanese yen. When an intervention occurs, an announcement is made on the BOCʹs website, and the amount of the intervention is in the governmentʹs monthly official press release on international reserves."
2011,624,Cape Verde,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Ministries of Finance and CBs of Portugal and Cape Verde are the institutions that can decide to change the exchange rate arrangement.

2011,228,Chile,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate of the peso is freely determined in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Chile (CBC) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market, in exceptional circumstances, to keep the currency near its equilibrium value in order to avoid costly reversals in the future. These interventions take the form of transparent, well-founded measures, which include explicit definitions of the periods and amounts involved and clearly explained reasons for these exceptional interventions. The CBC usually announces the amount of foreign exchange it intends to buy or sell in its monthly bulletin. Effective January 5, 2011, the CBC launched a foreign currency purchasing program aimed at strengthening its international liquidity position, through daily auctions to buy US$50 million up to a total of US$12 billion. Although it reserved the right to revise this auction amount responding to market conditions, the CBC never altered the amount. Effective December 16, 2011, auctions under the foreign currency purchasing program ended after the CBC purchased a cumulative total of US$12 billion. The CBC publishes its auction results on a daily basis and publishes its reserves on a weekly basis."
2011,924,China,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"China officially maintains a de jure managed floating exchange rate arrangement with a view to keeping the RMB exchange rate stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies to preserve stability of the Chinese economy and financial markets. In 2012, the Peopleʹs Bank of China (PBC) has renewed its commitment to promote price discovery and further enhance the flexibility of the RMB by allowing for increased fluctuations in both directions. To this end, effective April 16, 2012, the floating band of RMBʹs trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the interbank FX market has been widened from 0.5% to 1%, i.e., on each business day, the trading prices of the RMB against the U.S. dollar in the interbank FX market may fluctuate within a band of ±1% around the central parity released on the same day by the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. Since the PBC announced a more flexible exchange rate regime in June 2010 to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, the variability of the exchange rate has been consistently greater than previously, and the RMB gradually appreciated against the U.S. dollar by 7.8% through December 2011. Given that the RMB remained within the 2% margin against a trend through end-April 2012 (the reference date for this report), the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The PBC does not publish its intervention data."
2011,233,Colombia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. All foreign exchange transactions are conducted at a market-determined exchange rate; however, the Banco de la República (BR) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to adjust the level of international reserves, limit excess volatility of the exchange rate, and influence the speed of adjustment of the nominal exchange rate. The BRʹs interventions are based on the guidelines established by its board of directors. The monthly results of the BRʹs intervention in the foreign exchange market and information regarding each auction are available on its website. During 2011, the BR extended the daily foreign exchange purchase auctions several times until September, when they were replaced by an options auctions mechanism. However, this mechanism was never used, and in 2012, the BR suspended the options auctions mechanism and resumed the daily foreign exchange purchase auctions (for more detailed information on the auctions, see III.H.1.a.3: Auction)."
2011,632,Comoros,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is conventional peg. The Comoros participates in the franc zone area. The Comorian franc is officially pegged to the euro at the fixed rate of Comorian francs 491.96775 per euro; the value of other currencies is determined on the basis of this fixed rate and on the basis of the exchange rates of these currencies in the foreign exchange markets. The exchange rate arrangement is established in the following documents: (1) the Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the Comorian and French governments, November 23, 1979; (2) the decision by the European Council of Ministers authorizing France to maintain its monetary arrangements with both the CFA zone countries and the Comoros, November 23, 1998; and (3) the order by the governor of the Central Bank of Comoros (CBC) on euro-Comorian franc parity, January 14, 1999. A change to the exchange rate arrangement may be decided by the government of either the Comoros or France, after notifying the other party to the MCA."
2011,238,Costa Rica,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Since October 17, 2006, the de jure exchange rate arrangement has been classified as a crawling band arrangement characterized by increasing width. The band is defined in terms of colones per U.S. dollar and does not include a central parity. On January 23, 2009, the bandʹs upper bound (selling exchange rate) was set to C 0.20 per U.S. dollar a business day and the lower bound (purchasing exchange rate) was kept at C 500.00 per U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2011, the intervention purchasing and selling exchange rates were C 500.00 and C 712.35, respectively, indicating a band with a width of 42.5. Effective April 18, 2011, the foreign exchange purchase program started in September 2010 to accumulate international reserves ended after the US$600 million target was reached. This program, to the extent that it did not seek to influence the exchange rate in a given direction, helped raise the confidence of economic agents (reserves as “insurance”) and strengthen the international liquidity position, which because of its precautionary nature, was implemented by the Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR) as part of a financial policy rather than an exchange rate policy. In order to reinforce the economyʹs “financial shield,” effective January 25, 2012, the board of directors of the BCCR agreed to implement a new program to build international reserves between February 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, up to US$1,500 million. The BCCR stands ready to intervene in order to enforce the band. Since early 2011, the exchange rate has remained closer to the lower bound of the band. Given the permanence of the exchange rate band, with the direct support of the BCCR, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."

2011,960,Croatia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating without a predetermined path. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) may set intervention exchange rates, which it applies in transactions with banks outside the interbank market to limit exchange rate volatility (described under Section H. Foreign exchange market, a. Operated by the central bank, 3. Auctions). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. Intervention data (prices and volume) are published on the CNB website."
2011,354,Curaçao and Sint Maarten,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. Official buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are set daily on the basis of rates of the U.S. dollar abroad. The current peg was established in a national decree on December 24, 1971."
2011,423,Cyprus,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating.

2011,935,Czech Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The external value of the koruna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) participates. The CNB sells foreign exchange reserves revenues in order to prevent a continued rise in the level of such reserves and publishes its monthly foreign exchange transaction data on its website, with a two-month lag. Apart from its program of regular sales, the CNB last intervened in September 2002. It used only local market makers and traded at their rates. In addition to the aforementioned CNB participation in the foreign exchange market, there are off-market conversions of EU transfers and, in the past, there were conversions of large privatization receipts."
2011,636,Democratic Republic of the Congo,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Congo franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The BCC, while observing the international reserves target in its monetary program, intervenes to channel back to the market some of the reserves accumulated from external flows and to prevent the sharpest fluctuations, as measured by a daily fluctuation of ±1.5% in the U.S. dollar/franc rate. This is done in the context of an auction, which is the only operational framework for the BCCʹs transactions with the market. The BCC has intervened on both sides of the market. As a result, the franc followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band from May 2010 through April 2011, during which time the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a crawl-like arrangement. From May until mid-November 2011, the franc remained stabilized in a narrow band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from a crawl-like arrangement, effective May 1, 2011. In late November 2011, the franc appreciated sharply against the U.S. dollar, departing from the stabilized band for several months. During this time, the BCC purchased foreign exchange in the market, causing the franc to depreciate gradually back to preelection levels. Given the increased flexibility during this period, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective November 23, 2011. In early January, the exchange rate returned to the previous band, where it remained through the end of April."
2011,128,Denmark,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The formal framework for the Danish fixed exchange rate policy is the ERM II. Denmark participates in the ERM II with a central rate of DKr 746.038 per €100. The central rate is a conversion of the central rate vis-à-vis the deutsche mark before the third stage of the EMU and was last adjusted in January 1987. Denmark has entered into an agreement with the ECB and the euro area member countries on a narrower fluctuation band of ±2.25%. In recent years, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) has consistently maintained a stable krone within less than 1% of the central rate. The DNʹs net purchase or sale of foreign currency during a month is published at 4:00 p.m. on the second working day of the following month in the “Foreign Exchange and Liquidity” press release. The agreement on Denmarkʹs fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro within a narrow fluctuation band of ±2.25% around the central rate in ERM II was concluded at the informal meeting of the Ecofin Council of September 25–27, 1998, in Vienna, between the ministers for economy and finance and the CB governors of the EU member countries."
2011,611,Djibouti,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"Djiboutiʹs monetary system uses a currency board. The Djibouti franc has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1949, but the legislation establishing the currency board and determining the fixed exchange rate is Law No. 91/AN/05/5èmeL of January 16, 2005. The Central Bank of Djibouti (BCD) guarantees and provides for unlimited conversion into U.S. dollars of banknotes and coins used as legal tender in Djibouti. The full issuance of Djibouti francs is covered by foreign exchange reserves. The National Assembly of Djibouti has the authority to make decisions regarding changes in the exchange rate arrangement."
2011,321,Dominica,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Dominica participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2011,243,Dominican Republic,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) aims to increase the flexibility of the exchange rate alongside the implementation of the inflation-targeting framework formally adopted in 2012. The CBDR intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit exchange rate volatility. Since February 2010, the peso has depreciated gradually within a narrow band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBDR publishes data on foreign exchange sales and purchases in the foreign exchange market by different institutional actors (banks, exchange houses, and remittance houses). The data are published on a net basis."

The exchange rate is determined through supply and demand in the foreign exchange interbank market, in which the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) buys and sells foreign exchange daily at the prevailing rate. The CBE does not publish its intervention data. Following a period marked by a gradual depreciation through March 2011, the pound has stabilized against a currency basket and remained in a narrow band since April 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement from a crawl-like arrangement, effective April 1, 2011."

On January 1, 2001, the U.S. dollar became unrestricted legal tender with unlimited redeemability for the settlement of debt throughout El Salvador. The U.S. dollar is used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange. The Central Reserve Bank (CRB) must exchange colones in circulation for U.S. dollars at banks request at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per U.S. dollar."

2011,819,Fiji,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) does not publish intervention data. The power to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is provided in the Reserve Bank of Fiji Act. A change in the exchange rate arrangement may be proposed by the RBF and approved by the minister of finance.
2011,172,Finland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Finland joined the euro area on January 1, 1999. Finland participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2011, 16 other members of the EU (previously 15; now including Estonia) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011 while participating in a concerted G7 intervention in foreign exchange markets. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2011,962,Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. According to the Foreign Exchange Law, the denar exchange rate is freely determined on the basis of demand and supply of foreign exchange in the foreign exchange market. However, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) participates in the foreign exchange market in order to maintain a stable exchange rate. Thus, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The NBRM publishes data on daily turnover of the foreign exchange market, which also includes information on NBRM intervention. The NBRM publishes its intervention data on a regular basis in its Quarterly Reports and, since April 2011, in the Management of Foreign Reserves section of the Annual Report."

2011,646,Gabon,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. Gabon participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CAEMC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (“Joint Monetary Committee”) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to renounce the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that memberʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2011,915,Georgia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Georgia is floating. In March 2009, the National Bank of Georgia (NBG) introduced a multiple-price foreign exchange auction and phased out direct intervention to influence the price of the lari on the market. Since May 25, 2009, the authorities have intervened only through auctions. In light of the improved functioning of the foreign exchange market and the enhanced flexibility of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The lari showed limited volatility during the second half of 2011 and remained stable for a short period. However, since early 2012, there has been increased flexibility in the lari–U.S. dollar exchange rate. With respect to intervention data, the volume sold at NBGʹs FX auction and the average exchange rates are posted on the NBG website immediately after the auction."

2011,652,Ghana,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the cedi is determined in the market by both interbank foreign exchange activity and foreign exchange bureaus. Ghana joined the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the cedi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within a margin of ±15% around the central rate. However, the authorities have yet to implement these measures. The Bank of Ghana (BOG) does not publish information on its interventions."
2011,174,Greece,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating.

2011,328,Grenada,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Grenada participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2011,258,Guatemala,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. In accordance with the Monetary Law and the Free Foreign Exchange Convertibility Law, Guatemala has a flexible exchange rate arrangement in which the exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market by supply and demand. However, the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the nominal exchange rate, without affecting its trend. The BOG intervenes through foreign exchange auctions based on a transparent rule, which limits daily volatility. Effective January 1, 2011, the fluctuation margin (added to or subtracted from the five-day moving average of the exchange rate) used to determine whether the BOG may intervene was widened from 0.5% to 0.6%, in accordance with Monetary Board Resolution No. JM-161-2010. The BOG may also intervene on a discretionary basis whenever the nominal exchange rate shows unusual volatility. From January 1, 2011, through January 31, 2012, the BOG purchased US$443.65 million (on 39 occasions) and sold US$265.60 million (on 16 occasions). Most of the purchases took place between January and April 2011, as the quetzal was appreciating against the U.S. dollar. After a mild depreciation in May 2011, the quetzal has remained stable in a narrow band against the U.S. dollar while interventions continued. Due to the stability of the exchange rate during this period, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from floating, effective June 1, 2011. Intervention data are publicly available on the BOGʹs website."
2011,656,Guinea,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Guinea announced its participation in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which formally limits the fluctuation of the franc to ±15% around a central rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, but this has yet to be implemented. The CB intervenes once a week through a foreign exchange auction market with banks. However, a structural excess demand of foreign exchange is not reflected in the exchange rate set during the weekly auctions. Effective July 28, 2011, transactions of commercial banks with their customers are bound within a band of ±3% around the last rate set during the weekly auctions. Given the frequent changes in the foreign exchange operational framework, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea (CBRG) regularly publishes information regarding foreign exchange market interventions."
2011,654,Guinea-Bissau,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Guinea-Bissau participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2011,336,Guyana,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; the exchange rate of the Guyana dollar is determined in the cambio market. The Bank of Guyana (BOG) periodically purchases foreign currency from cambio dealers in order to maintain international reserves at acceptable levels. In accordance with bilateral agreements with the CARICOM CBs, the BOG quotes weekly rates for certain CARICOM currencies. Reflecting the stability of the Guyana dollar against the U.S. dollar as a result of interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2011,263,Haiti,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Due to the depreciating trend the gourde has followed against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been classified as a crawl-like arrangement since April 2008, except for a disruption in the exchange rate market after the January 2010 earthquake, during which the gourde was classified as other managed arrangement for a short period from January through February 2010. Foreign exchange sales and purchases by the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) are used for smoothing exchange rate fluctuations. The BRH publishes information on foreign exchange interventions weekly on its website."
2011,268,Honduras,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling band. The exchange rate of the lempira is determined by foreign exchange auctions of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). The BCH maintains an operational band requiring all bid prices for the purchase of foreign exchange to be within a range of 7% above or below the base price, with such prices subject to the requirement that bids in auctions not exceed 0.075% of the average reference exchange rate (TCR) derived from auctions during the preceding seven business days. The base price is revised weekly according to a procedure established by the BCH board of directors for this purpose, which includes the following variables: (1) the differential between the domestic inflation rate and the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners, (2) changes in the exchange rates of these countriesʹ currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and (3) the performance of official reserve assets. The external inflation rate is considered to be the weighted average of the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners. Domestic inflation is measured by the consumer price index. The change in the U.S. dollar exchange rates of the main trading partners is measured using the effective exchange rate index, which is compiled weekly on the basis of the weighted average of the exchange rates of the main trading partners expressed in units of their respective currencies to US$1.00. Finally, an adjustment factor is applied to the base price of the auction, depending on the number of months of imports covered by the BCHʹs reserve assets. Effective July 25, 2011, the BCH reactivated the crawling band system that had been in operation until mid-2005. As a result, following a long period of stability (since May 2005), the lempira was allowed to crawl once again in July 2011 and thereafter followed a steadily depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar, with a small one-time adjustment in November 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective July 25, 2011. The CB publishes its sales of foreign exchange on its website daily."
2011,532,Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires the monetary base to be at least 100% backed by and the changes in it to be 100% matched by the corresponding changes in the reserve currency (U.S. dollar) at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75–HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—was adopted May 18, 2005. The monetary base includes notes and coins issued, the balance held with the HKMA of banksʹ clearing accounts (i.e., the aggregate balance), and outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Consistent with currency board principles, the HKMA may issue additional Exchange Fund paper when there is an inflow of funds, and the program may expand along with the interest payments on such paper. Issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which back banknotes issued by note-issuing banks (NIBs), must be made against U.S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. Issuance and withdrawal of government-issued notes and coins are settled against U.S. dollars at the same fixed rate. The legal documents that establish the currency board include the Basic Law (Chapter V, Section 1, Articles 110 and 111); the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66); and an Exchange of Letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system of Hong Kong SAR under the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The Exchange of Letters specifies that the Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system, including the linked exchange rate. Section 3(1) of the ordinance, as amended, specifies that the Exchange Fund “shall be under the control of the Financial Secretary and shall be used primarily for such purposes as the Financial Secretary thinks fit affecting, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong SAR and for other purposes incidental thereto.” The HKMA is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments, and operational means for doing so, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary system. The HKMA makes immediate announcements of the impact on the aggregate balance due to purchases or sales of U.S. dollars by the Currency Board via various information vendors, including Reuters and Bloomberg. The information is also available on the HKMA website."
2011,944,Hungary,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating because of the discretionary interventions made by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) in the foreign exchange market. The possible objectives of foreign exchange intervention are listed in the MNBʹs intervention strategy, which has not been published. The strategy aims to avoid disruptive market fluctuations and exchange rate overshooting. However, the strategy emphasizes that the MNB generally refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange market. The MNB converts foreign currency for the government and net current and capital transfers from the EU on the foreign exchange market at foreign exchange market rates. These transactions change the foreign exchange reserve position of the MNB. If the resulting reserve dynamics are not in line with the MNBʹs reserve management objectives, some of the funds are channeled to the market. Transactions are conducted in small amounts at market prices. The MNB announced the policy of channeling the foreign exchange position resulting from the government-related foreign exchange flows to the market. The net amounts are published quarterly in the MNBʹs Quarterly and Annual Reports."
2011,176,Iceland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) may intervene in the interbank foreign exchange market and has done so occasionally. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is floating. Data on the CBIʹs foreign exchange buying and selling are published daily on its website."
2011,534,India,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBIʹs role is to modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. The RBI has no fixed or preannounced target or band for the exchange rate. In its interventions, the RBI purchases and sells U.S. dollars spot and forward in the interbank market at the market exchange rate. The RBI deals only with ADs and publishes monthly data on its interventions (foreign exchange purchases and sales) in both the spot and the forward markets in the RBI Monthly Bulletin."
2011,536,Indonesia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating (adopted August 14, 1997). The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank Indonesia (BI), however, may intervene—as part of a policy mix—whenever necessary to achieve the inflation target and the stability of the rupiah exchange rate. When it intervenes, the BI does not target a specific rate or maintain exchange rate movements within a specific band. In February 2011, the exchange rate left the stabilized band as the rupiah started to appreciate against the U.S. dollar. Due to the increased flexibility of the exchange rate after a period of limited volatility, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement, effective February 14, 2011. The BI does not disclose data on its interventions."
2011,433,Iraq,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has allowed the exchange rate to appreciate gradually vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar following a predetermined path. Within these limits, the exchange rate of the dinar is determined in the foreign exchange market. Since January 2009, the CBI has set the rate of crawl at zero, stabilizing the exchange rate at about ID 1,170 per U.S. dollar through January 16, 2012, and, subsequently, ID 1,166 per U.S. dollar, effective January 17, 2012. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar. The intervention data are published on the CBI website."
2011,178,Ireland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Ireland participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2011, 16 other members of the EU (previously 15; now including Estonia) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011 while participating in a concerted G7 intervention in foreign exchange markets. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2011,429,Islamic Republic of Iran,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a managed floating arrangement against a basket of currencies since 2002. The rial remained stable within a 2% band against a composite through the first half of 2011. However, the spread between the interbank exchange rate and the parallel market rate at exchange bureaus increased substantially since mid-2011, reaching 50% as of the end of January 2012. In the meantime, the interbank exchange rate adjusted gradually, initially through January 2012, and after a one-time depreciation in late January remained stable through the end of April. Because there was no discernible pattern for the rial, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective May 1, 2011."
2011,436,Israel,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the Bank of Israel (BOI) announced in August 2009 that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market in the event of unusual movement in the exchange rate that is inconsistent with underlying economic conditions or when conditions are disorderly. The BOI ceased its interventions in the foreign exchange market since August 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to free floating from floating, effective August 1, 2011. The BOI publishes its monthly net foreign exchange purchases in a communiqué."

Italy participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2011, 16 other members of the EU (previously, 15; now including Estonia) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions. For the first time since 2000, the ECB intervened in March 2011 alongside other G7 members to calm foreign exchange markets in the wake of the Japanese Pacific earthquake. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2011,343,Jamaica,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market, where the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) intervenes frequently. As a result of official actions, the Jamaican dollar remained stable against the U.S. dollar from February 2009 through May 2011, with a one-time step realignment in June 2010. Beginning in June 2011, the exchange rate was allowed to adjust on a gradual basis while official interventions in the foreign exchange market continued. As a result, the Jamaican dollar followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%. Given the pattern of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective June 1, 2011. The BOJ publishes information on its foreign exchange market interventions in its Annual Report and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report. The BOJ purchases foreign exchange from ADs and cambios under the following terms: (1) Purchases are made in U.S. dollars, Canadian dollars, pounds sterling, and euros. (2) The minimum amount the BOJ will purchase in a single transaction is 50,000 units of a foreign currency. (3) The exchange rates for these currencies are negotiated by the BOJ. The BOJ publishes the amount and the prices of bilateral trade transactions in the interbank foreign exchange market. The BOJ also posts clientsʹ orders on its website."
2011,158,Japan,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the yen is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disorderly conditions in the market. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Interventions fall within the mandate of the MOF, which publishes daily purchases and sales amounts as well as intervention currencies on its website. The Bank of Japan (BOJ), acting as agent of the minister of finance, intervenes in the market through financial institutions and/or brokers. For the first time since 2004, the MOF intervened in the foreign exchange market on September 15, 2010. Subsequently, on March 18, 2011 (¥692.5 billion), in the extraordinary circumstances following the earthquake and tsunami, the MOF, in coordination with other G7 countries, intervened in the foreign exchange market. The MOF intervened again on August 4, 2011 (¥4,512.9 billion) and from October 31 through November 4, 2011 (¥9,091.6 billion) to address excess volatility and disorderly exchange rate movement."
2011,439,Jordan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dinar is officially pegged to the SDR, but in practice, it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since late 1995. The CBJ is responsible for maintaining the stability of the dinar exchange rate. The CBJ does not intervene in the foreign exchange market."
2011,916,Kazakhstan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float, effective February 28, 2011 (previously, a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands). The main intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Intervention in the foreign exchange market seeks to smooth out demand and supply fluctuations and is prompted by second-tier banksʹ foreign exchange supply and demand. The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) may conduct foreign exchange operations both on the regulated Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) and on the interbank (OTC) foreign exchange markets. The NBK intervenes on its own behalf directly with market participants based on their quotes and does not publish information on its interventions. The trading band that had been established in February 2009 against the U.S. dollar was abandoned, effective February 25, 2011, and a transition to a managed floating regime was announced February 28, 2011. Since October 2009, the tenge has tracked a trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2011,664,Kenya,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. Official foreign exchange market interventions aim to moderate the rate of change and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than to establish a particular level. Data on interventions are only partially disclosed. If the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) uses the auction system to intervene, the market is informed of the amount dealt and the average rate. (The average rate is published after the auction closes.) If the CBK chooses to intervene directly (i.e., by buying or selling foreign exchange from or to banks directly through the Reuters dealing system), the market is informed but amounts and rates are not published."
2011,826,Kiribati,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. There is no central monetary institution, and the authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange. The ANZ Bank (Kiribati) Limited, the only commercial bank, quotes daily rates for 15 currencies on the basis of their respective rates against the Australian dollar."
2011,542,Korea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the won is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. As such, the system is managed in accordance with the principles defined by the free floating system, and the governmentʹs role is very limited to remain within the range allowed by the free floating system. However, because of the lack of information on the authoritiesʹ interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Korea (BOK) may intervene in the market with the funds of the BOK and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund when it is deemed necessary for the stability of the market. Interventions in the spot market or through derivatives in the forward market are not announced, and intervention data are not published."

2011,443,Kuwait,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. According to the law of the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK), the exchange rate arrangement is specified by an “amiri” decree in consultation with the governor of the CBK (see CBK Law, Chapter I, Article II). The arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. Intervention data are not disclosed to the public."
2011,917,Kyrgyz Republic,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) participates and intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market to reduce exchange rate volatility as necessary. In line with ad hoc but frequent adjustments in the som–U.S. dollar exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The NBKR publishes its daily purchases and sales of foreign exchange on its website."
2011,544,Lao P.D.R.,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The kip has remained consistently stable vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2011,941,Latvia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. Latvia participates in the ERM II. The Bank of Latvia (BOL) publishes its intervention data on a weekly basis.
2011,446,Lebanon,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is free floating. In practice, the exchange rate remains within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Banque du Liban (BDL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market daily from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and from 10:00 a.m. until noon on Friday. The BDL does not publish intervention data."
2011,666,Lesotho,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The loti is pegged to the South African rand at M 1 per R 1. The exchange rate is backed by the net international reserves position target of US$650–US$700 million.
2011,668,Liberia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to counter speculative movements. From January until early November 2011, the Liberian dollar remained stable in a 2% band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Due to the stability of the exchange rate during this period, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to a stabilized arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective January 5, 2011. In early November 2011, the exchange rate departed from the stabilized band, showing increased but limited flexibility while still being managed. Accordingly, effective November 7, 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement.

2011,946,Lithuania,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board was established by the Law on Credibility of the Litas and has been in effect since April 1, 1994. The litas exchange rate against the euro was fixed by the Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania “on the approbation of the proposal of the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) regarding the anchor currency and the litas official exchange rate” (February 1, 2002, No. 157) and the Resolution of the Bank of Lithuania “on the anchor currency and the official exchange rate of the litas” (February 1, 2002, No. 15). According to the Law on Credibility of the Litas, the BOL covers all its liabilities denominated in litai with its foreign reserves. The BOL provides a foreign exchange window for commercial banks and branches of foreign credit institutions (subject to reserve requirements) at their request. The statistics of the operations conducted can be found under the section “Liquidity Situation in the Banking System” on the BOL website."
2011,137,Luxembourg,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Luxembourg participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2011, 16 other members of the EU (previously 15; now including Estonia) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011 while participating in a concerted G7 intervention in foreign exchange markets. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2011,674,Madagascar,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the official interbank market. The Central Bank of Madagascar (CBM) intervenes in the interbank market to smooth large exchange rate fluctuations and meet foreign reserve targets. Information on CBM daily interventions is not publicly available. Only the weighted average daily rate and the number and amount of transactions are made available to the public through the CBM official site. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating.
2011,676,Malawi,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Official intervention focuses on meeting the net foreign reserves position target and limiting exchange rate volatility and takes into account seasonal fluctuations. The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) is a large supplier of foreign exchange in the market and is therefore able to significantly influence the official rates. At the time of the official announcement of a floating exchange rate regime in December 2009, the kwacha initially depreciated for a short time. The kwacha then stabilized and remained in a 2% band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar from February 2010 through early August 2011. After the devaluation in August 2011, the kwacha showed limited but sufficient flexibility, departing from the 2% band on both sides, while official actions continued to play an important role in influencing the exchange rate. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective August 8, 2011. Effective May 7, 2012, the RBM devalued the kwacha from MK 168 to MK 250 per U.S. dollar. In anticipation of this devaluation, the RBM took steps aimed at allowing market forces to determine the exchange rate and at improved availability of foreign exchange in the market. Accordingly, effective May 7, 2012, the RBM implemented the revised Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Trading Activities, allowing for more market determination of the exchange rate."
2011,548,Malaysia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) operates a de jure managed float for the ringgit with reference to a currency basket. The composition of the basket is not disclosed. As a result of the ringgit tracking a composite, although not closely enough to be classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BNM does not publish its intervention data. The BNM may also transact directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers at the rates it deems fit for the purpose of maintaining orderly market conditions without targeting any particular level of the exchange rate."
2011,556,Maldives,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Effective April 11, 2011, the Maldives government adopted a new exchange rate regime under which the rufiyaa will float in a band of 20% in either direction around a central parity of Rf 12.85 per U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Previously, it was a conventional pegged arrangement, with the rufiyaa pegged to the U.S. dollar at a buying rate of Rf 12.75 per U.S. dollar and a selling rate of Rf 12.85 per U.S. dollar. After adoption of a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands, the rufiyaa remained stabilized in a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from a conventional peg, effective April 11, 2011."
2011,678,Mali,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Mali participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."

2011,682,Mauritania,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The ouguiya was previously de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar, at an exchange rate of UM 268.6 per U.S. dollar (from October 2005 through January 2007). Since January 2007, the new foreign exchange market uses a fixing system in which the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) intervenes. The BCM intervenes in order to regulate the exchange market according to its exchange rate policy objectives (smoothing the exchange rate and the projected level of official reserves). Due to the authoritiesʹ control over the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. A summary statement of market turnover data, including official interventions, is updated daily on the BCM website."
2011,684,Mauritius,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The BOM states that intervention in the foreign exchange market is limited to smoothing operations and does not aim to offset market forces. After a period of no intervention between December 2008 and June 2010, the BOM started intervening again in July 2010. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Information regarding interventions is published regularly on the BOM website and in its publications."
2011,273,Mexico,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the peso is determined in the foreign exchange market. Effective November 30, 2011, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) temporarily suspended the mechanism of monthly put option auctions until further notice. Previously, the BOM used put options, giving the buyer the right to sell U.S. dollars when the exchange rate appreciated above its 20-day moving average, as an intervention mechanism. The BOM sold US$600 million in put options each month from February 2010 through October 30, 2011, and bought foreign exchange amounting to US$9.08 billion from option holders who exercised these options 50 times during the same period. Effective November 30, 2011, the BOM announced it would sell up to US$400 million daily through auctions at a minimum price that is 2% below (1.02 times Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar) the previous dayʹs average in the event of a more than 2% depreciation from the previous day. However, this mechanism had not been used as of April 30, 2012. The BOM may also organize unscheduled auctions, which it has not done since January 2009. The BOM reserves the right to make extraordinary sales of foreign exchange if necessary due to market conditions. Since November 201, the BOM has not intervened in the foreign exchange market through any mechanism. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to free floating from floating, effective November 1, 2011."
2011,868,Micronesia,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of the Federated States of Micronesia is the U.S. dollar. The authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange.
2011,921,Moldova,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Moldova (NBM) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the leu against the U.S. dollar. Sharp exchange rate fluctuations are not specifically defined; however, the NBM intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market based on market conditions and future expectations of market participants. These interventions do not aim to change the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM intervenes directly at the market quoted rates and publishes aggregated monthly data regarding its interventions and the interbank market turnover on its website. The data show interventions by currency and type of operation (spot or derivative)."
2011,948,Mongolia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The BOM reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market using the U.S. dollar as the principal intervention currency.

Since April 2001, the basket has been composed of the euro and the U.S. dollar, with weights of 80% and 20%, respectively. The Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) publishes its monthly foreign exchange purchases and sales on its website. Authority to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is found in Dahir No. 1-05-38 of November 23, 2005, promulgating Law No. 76-03 establishing the charter of the BAM (Chapter II, Missions, Section I, Core missions, Article 8)."
2011,688,Mozambique,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. As a major conduit for aid flows, the BM is the main channel for foreign exchange into the market. It also intervenes to smooth seasonal fluctuations and for sterilization purposes. In its foreign exchange buying and selling transactions (including auction sales) in the MCI—Mozambiqueʹs interbank foreign exchange market—the BM uses the same-day quotes shown on the screen for each bank throughout MCI business hours, based on the best price criterion (highest sale price and lowest purchase price). The BM discloses information on its website regarding foreign exchange transactions carried out in the MCI. In the Jornal Notícias, the BM publishes only the table of indicative rates of exchange in the foreign exchange market."
2011,518,Myanmar,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a managed float from a conventional peg to the SDR at K 8.50847 per SDR, effective April 2, 2012. According to an announcement by the CBM, the value of the kyat is determined by the financial markets, with the CBM reserving the right to periodically intervene to mitigate undue exchange rate volatility and support the liquidity of the kyat in the foreign exchange market. The CBM has no predetermined target for the level of the kyat exchange rate or its trading range and expects the value to fluctuate with supply and demand in the market consistent with the expectations of a floating exchange rate regime. Due to the multiple exchange rates and divergence of these rates from the official rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been classified as other managed arrangement. Since April 1, 2012, there has been progress in converging toward a unified exchange rate, but this process was still in transition as of April 30, 2012."
2011,728,Namibia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement is the CMA agreement.

The exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may intervene if the exchange rate is exceptionally high or low, if that rate is not justified by economic fundamentals, and if there is a material prospect that the intervention will influence the exchange rate. Interventions may not be used as an attempt to influence the long-term trend of the exchange rate. As a result, RBNZ interventions are very rare. The RBNZ publishes information on its foreign currency intervention capacity (stock of reserves available for foreign exchange intervention) and foreign exchange swap position on its website but does not publish data on its direct intervention."
2011,278,Nicaragua,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The Central Bank of Nicaragua (CBN) publishes aggregated monthly data pertaining to CBN foreign exchange transactions with the banks and the government.

2011,694,Nigeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The CBN explicitly aims to maintain an exchange rate principally driven by market forces but intervenes to reduce volatility and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. On November 21, 2011, the CBN adjusted the midpoint of the target exchange rate from 150 naira per U.S. dollar to 155 naira per U.S. dollar with a soft exchange rate band of ±3% (unchanged) to accommodate continued downward exchange market pressure. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The CBN publishes information on its interventions through auction on its website; however, data on interventions in the interbank market are not disseminated. Even though Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires maintaining the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar within ±15% around the central rate, the CBN has not implemented this regime."
2011,142,Norway,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the krone floats freely and independently against other currencies. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Norges Bank (NB) does not normally intervene to influence the exchange rate of the krone; however, it may intervene in the foreign exchange market on short notice if the krone deviates substantially from the level the NB considers reasonable in relation to fundamentals and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target. The NB may also intervene in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level. The NB has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999. Foreign exchange purchases for the Government Pension Fund Global are publicly preannounced on the CB website. In extraordinary circumstances, the NB may provide foreign exchange liquidity via collateralized operations. This was done between September 2008 and July 2009."

2011,564,Pakistan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) does not explicitly or implicitly commit to an exchange rate target or path. Market intervention has generally been directed toward building foreign exchange reserves and ensuring smooth functioning of the foreign exchange market. Following a period of stability, the rupee departed from the 2% stabilized band against the U.S. dollar in early April 2011, and started to float more freely. Because of the increased flexibility of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to floating from a stabilized arrangement, effective April 11, 2011. The SBP does not publish information regarding its intervention."

2011,288,Paraguay,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; the exchange rate of the guaraní is determined by supply and demand. The Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) intervenes in the exchange market to smooth the effects of undue fluctuations. The objective of the CBP under Article 3 of its Organic Law (No. 489/95) is to preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Moreover, Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the CBP aims to smooth seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. Article 47 establishes that the exchange rate is determined by market forces. The CBP publishes information on its foreign exchange interventions in the Informe Económico (Economic Report) posted each month on its website. Given the focus of the monetary authorities on exchange rate stability, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2011,293,Peru,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the nuevo sol is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) is authorized by law to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The stated goal of these interventions is to limit foreign exchange volatility without altering the exchange rateʹs primary trend. Intervention may also be conducted using bonds indexed to the exchange rate and repos. The BCRP publishes information regarding its interventions (prices and amounts) on its website on a daily basis. From September 2009 through March 2011, the nuevo sol tracked an appreciating trend vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar consistent with a crawl-like arrangement. Due to the increased flexibility in the nuevo sol–U.S. dollar exchange rate in April 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from a crawl-like arrangement, effective April 1, 2011. Since October 2011, the exchange rate showed limited volatility while it continued to appreciate."
2011,566,Philippines,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) adheres to a market-determined exchange rate policy with some scope for occasional action solely to prevent potentially disruptive sharp fluctuations. The BSP does not target or support a given level of exchange rate; it allows the value of the peso to be determined by supply and demand. The BSP may participate in the U.S. dollar–peso market directly with market participants or via market makers and does not disclose intervention data, which are for internal use only. However, data on currency swaps settled in foreign currency and nondeliverable forwards settled in domestic currency are reported monthly in Sections II and IV, respectively, of the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which is posted on the BSP website."
2011,964,Poland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the zloty is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, and the zloty is traded freely against all currencies. The National Bank of Poland (NBP), however, reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market, should such intervention be necessary to ensure domestic macroeconomic and financial stability, which is conducive to meeting the inflation target in the medium term. The NBP resumed interventions to stabilize the market and prevent speculation, with the first intervention on September 23, 2011, followed with more on September 30, October 3, November 23, December 29, and December 30, 2011. Because the NBP intervened in more than three instances in a six-month period, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from free floating, effective September 23, 2011. Given that NBP interventions ceased after December 30, 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to free floating from floating, effective December 31, 2011. In addition, the MOF has increased its sale of EU funds at the foreign exchange market since April 2011."

2011,453,Qatar,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The targeted peg was officially authorized by Amiri Decree No. 34 of 2001 issued in July 2001, replacing the de jure exchange rate policy of pegging to the SDR, which had been in effect since 1975. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) does not publish data on its interventions."
2011,634,Republic of Congo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. The Republic of Congo participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CAEMC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (“Joint Monetary Committee”) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to renounce the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that member countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2011,968,Romania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) may intervene to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations. There is no formal definition of excessive exchange rate fluctuations: the assessment is based on domestic and international market circumstances and on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The NBR intervenes either directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers. The NBR does not publish information on its interventions. The NBR has the authority to change the exchange rate arrangement.
2011,922,Russia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement—namely a controlled floating exchange rate arrangement. The ruble value of a dual-currency basket is used as the operating benchmark for transactions in the domestic foreign exchange market. The dual-currency basket, including the U.S. dollar and the euro, has been used by the Bank of Russia (BR) as an operating benchmark for currency interventions since 2005. Initially, the composition of the basket was €0.10 and US$0.90, but as the participants of the domestic foreign exchange market adapted to the new conditions, the BR revised its composition, increasing the euro share. The basket now is composed of €0.45 and US$0.55. The BR establishes an operational floating range of its allowable levels with automatic revisions of boundaries depending on the volume of currency interventions. The value of the dual-currency basket is determined under the influence of both market factors and exchange interventions by the BR. Since the elimination, as of October 13, 2010, of the fixed exchange band, no targets or fixed limits on the BR exchange rate have been established for the value of the dual-currency basket (Rub 26-41 had been in effect since January 2009). Interventions take place both on boundaries and within bands. The operating interval also includes the range in which currency interventions are not made. Revision of the boundaries of the operating interval occurs automatically when the established value is reached by the cumulative volume of BR operations. In order to offset a systematic imbalance between supply and demand for foreign exchange on the domestic market, the volume of targeted interventions is not included in the calculation of that amount. The BR implemented the following changes in currency policy: (1) It widened the band of allowable fluctuations of the Rub from Rub 4 to Rub 5, effective March 1, 2011, from Rub 5 to Rub 6, effective December 27, 2011, and from Rub 6 to Rub 7, effective July 24, 2012; (2) It reduced the size of the accumulated interventions on the bandʹs edge by 5 kopeks from US$650 to US$600 million, effective March 1, 2011, from US$600 million to US$500 million, effective December 27, 2011, and from US$500 million to US$450 million, effective July 24, 2012. Due to the continued control of the BR over exchange rate determination, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BR intervenes both in interbank currency exchanges and in the OTC interbank market to smooth out daily fluctuations. Since August 2008, the BR has published its volume of interventions on a monthly basis. These data are presented within seven days of the end of the reporting period."
2011,714,Rwanda,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) sells francs at a predetermined reference price to market participants and the government. Since January 2010, the franc followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar in a 2% band, with a reduced rate of depreciation since May 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BNR does not disclose any data on its interventions in the foreign exchange market."
2011,862,Samoa,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite.

Currently, there is no legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement, except the CBS Act of 1984, which states only that the CBS is responsible for setting the exchange rate."
2011,135,San Marino,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. San Marino has a monetary agreement with Italy, on behalf of the EU, that went into effect April 1, 2001, and (1) establishes that euro coins and banknotes are legal tender in San Marino; and (2) gives San Marino the authority to issue a certain number of euro coins, which are legal tender in the euro area and are equivalent in form to euro area coinage. On March 27, 2012, San Marino signed a new monetary agreement with the EU repealing the previous monetary agreement of November 29, 2000. The new agreement authorizes San Marino to use the euro as its official currency, grant legal tender status to euro banknotes and coins, and issue limited quantities of euro coins (as did the former agreement). Under the new agreement, San Marino commits to adopt the relevant EU legislation (on euro banknotes and coins; combating fraud and counterfeiting; banking and financial legislation, including the prevention of money laundering and statistical reporting requirements). The new agreement will go into effect on notification of the EU of the completion of the ratification by the Parliament of San Marino."
2011,716,São Tomé and Príncipe,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg against the euro. Beginning February 1, 2009, the focus of the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) switched from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which became the new reference currency for managing the exchange rate. The organic law of the CB authorizes it to make decisions regarding exchange rate policy."
2011,456,Saudi Arabia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The GCC Supreme Economic Council adopted the U.S. dollar as a nominal anchor on December 31, 2001, with an effective date of January 1, 2003. The rate of the riyal against the U.S. dollar is determined by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) and has been stable since June 1986. The SAMA, in coordination with the minister of finance, decides on changes in the exchange rate arrangement. Historically, the SAMA has not published its intervention data."
2011,722,Senegal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Senegal participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2011,942,Serbia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Although the current Decision on the Dinar Exchange Rate Regime stipulates “managed floating” (according to the previous IMF classification system), the main features of the current regime correspond to the description of a “floating” regime based on the IMFʹs new classification system (occasional interventions to moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate without aiming for a specific level of the exchange rate). Since the introduction of this exchange rate regime in 2001 and in accordance with its commitment to liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has tried to reduce its participation in the foreign exchange market and to adjust the features of the existing exchange rate regime—managed floating—in the direction of soft managed floating so as to pave the way for a freely floating exchange rate regime as a prerequisite for the adoption of inflation targeting. This exchange rate regime enables the NBS to balance, when necessary, foreign exchange demand and supply and moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate in either direction (appreciation or depreciation) that may occur under the influence of external or internal shocks to the national economy. NBS interventions do not aim to achieve a particular level of the exchange rate. In accordance with Inflation Targeting as Monetary Strategy (as of January 1, 2009), interventions are an infrequent secondary instrument used to support the achievement of the inflation target only after the potential for influencing inflation effectively through changing the key policy rate is exhausted. Interventions in the foreign exchange market take place only to moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate of the dinar, in either direction (appreciation or depreciation), in order to contain threats to financial and price stability. NBS interventions in the foreign exchange market amounted to sales of €90 million and purchases of €45 million in 2011, compared with 2010 sales of €2,570 million and purchases of €237 million aimed at moderating excessive daily exchange rate fluctuation."
2011,718,Seychelles,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by demand and supply in the market, with the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) intervening only to smooth exchange rate volatility and manage liquidity. Operational guidelines specify the role of the CBS as the buyer/seller of last resort in the foreign exchange market. CBS interventions in the foreign exchange market have declined considerably. The CBS discloses intervention data on its website, which is publicly accessible."
2011,724,Sierra Leone,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating, and the exchange rate of the leone is market determined. The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) publishes its weekly foreign exchange offer amount and the result of the weekly foreign exchange auctions through the print media and radio and on its website. The auction rate is used as a reference rate by market participants but the auction constitutes only about 7% of official foreign exchange transactions. There is no policy aimed at targeting a specific exchange rate level. Occasionally, the BSL buys foreign exchange in the market to build up its reserves and sells it through the foreign exchange auction. Effective March 16, 2011, the weekly auction amount was raised from US$700,000 to US$1 million."
2011,576,Singapore,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The authorities manage the exchange rate as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the objective of maintaining price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. The Singapore dollar is allowed to fluctuate within a targeted policy band and is managed against a basket of currencies of the countryʹs major trading partners and competitors. Currencies in the basket are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the countries in Singaporeʹs trade relations with the world. The exchange rate policy is announced every six months in the Monetary Policy Statement, typically in terms of changes to the slope, central rate, and width of the policy band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) intervenes through agents and does not publish information on its interventions. The Singapore dollar tracked an appreciating trend against a basket of currencies within a 2% band from April 2010 through September 2011. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from other managed, effective April 14, 2010. Beginning in September 2011, the Singapore dollar departed from the crawl-like band without showing any discernible pattern, while the authoritiesʹ official exchange rate policy of managing the exchange rate remained unchanged. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a crawl-like arrangement, effective September 12, 2011."

2011,813,Solomon Islands,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The official exchange rate regime of pegging the Solomon Islands dollar to a basket of currency remains unchanged. The exchange rate of the Solomon Islands dollar is calculated on the basis of a basket of foreign currency but further managed by the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) through daily interventions to determine its value vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Even though the method of exchange rate calculation was not changed, the currency composition and weights of the basket, which are determined on the basis of the volume and direction of the countryʹs trade, were updated, effective February 1, 2011. The currency basket comprises the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, euro, and yen. After implementation of the updated currency basket in February 2011, the Solomon Islands dollar began to appreciate and move more freely against the U.S. dollar. Due to the increased flexibility, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from a conventional peg, effective February 1, 2011. The CBSI determines the exchange rate of the Solomon Islands dollar against the U.S. dollar and Australian dollar with a mandatory spread and publishes for commercial banks the U.S. dollar/Solomon Islands dollar buying and selling rates and mandatory spread limits. Under the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands Act, the CBSI may change the exchange rate arrangement only on written instructions from the minister of finance."

The exchange rate of the rand is determined by demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has a publicly announced policy of purchasing foreign currency in the foreign exchange market from time to time, when market conditions permit, with the aim of gradually building up its foreign reserves without seeking to influence the level of the exchange rate. The SARB interacts with ADs as the price taker for official and commercial purposes. However, the SARB does not sell foreign exchange to ADs. The market makers and brokers quote prices to other market participants; the SARB does not quote prices for market participants. The SARB does not publish information on its interventions, but it publishes a monthly release on its official gold and foreign exchange reserves."

2011,524,Sri Lanka,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating since its introduction by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on January 23, 2001. The CBSL intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the exchange rate. During 2010, despite increased capital inflows, a very stable exchange rate was maintained and the rupee followed an appreciating trend (at an annualized rate of 3.35%) against the U.S. dollar within a narrow band from March 2010 through April 2011, during which time the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a crawl-like arrangement against the U.S. dollar. In May 2011, the rupee stabilized at around SL Rs. 110 against the U.S. dollar, with a one-time step adjustment on November 22, 2011. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from a crawl-like arrangement, effective May 1, 2011. Since early February 2012, the authorities have limited their interventions in the foreign exchange market and allowed for increased flexibility against the U.S. dollar. As a result, the rupee–U.S. dollar exchange rate departed from the stabilized band and moved more freely. Accordingly, effective February 9, 2012, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement. The CBSL publishes intervention data on its website in its annual report."
2011,361,St. Kitts and Nevis,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Kitts and Nevis participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender.

2011,732,Sudan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating. The exchange rate is determined in the interbank market, in which participants deal directly with each other. The CBOS participates in the market through swaps under a rules-based mechanism that triggers intervention if the exchange rate exceeds a band of ±3% around the previous dayʹs closing rate. The main objective of the policy is exchange rate stability. Since April 2011, the official exchange rate has been stable, while the curb market exchange rate continued to move freely, diverging from the official rate. Given the focus of the CBOS on exchange rate stability and in line with curb market exchange rate movements, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The CBOS does not disclose information on its interventions to the public."
2011,366,Suriname,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"In accordance with a July 1994 presidential decree, the exchange rate is determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange. The exchange rate of the Surinamese dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official market remained stable until January 20, 2011, when the authorities devalued the currency by 20%, to SRD 3.3 per U.S. dollar, and set a band of SRD 3.25–3.35 per U.S. dollar, within which all official and commercial market transactions may take place. However, the Surinamese dollar–U.S. dollar exchange rate remained within a narrower band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. In the event of a persistent discrepancy between the official rate and the rates quoted by commercial banks and nonbank institutions, the official exchange rate is adjusted to reflect the prevailing market conditions."
2011,734,Swaziland,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The Central Bank of Swaziland Order, 1974 is the legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement."
2011,144,Sweden,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the krona is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are allowed under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., participation in concerted interventions with other CBs). Sveriges Riksbank (SR) announces its intervention in a press communiqué, explains the motive, and discloses the framework of intervention. However, no intervention has been reported since June 14, 2001."
2011,146,Switzerland,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market. However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free market rates. On September 6, 2011, the SNB set a minimum exchange rate of Sw F 1.20 per euro to stop appreciation of the franc and committed to maintaining the limit by buying unlimited foreign currency. In 2011, to combat massive overvaluation and to secure the minimum exchange rate, the SNB purchased approximately Sw F 17.8 billion in foreign currency with a wide range of counterparties in Switzerland and abroad. Based on the role of official action in influencing the exchange rate and the actual relative stability of the Swiss franc vis-à-vis the euro, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed arrangement from free floating, effective September 6, 2011. The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual accountability report."
2011,463,Syria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Since the revaluation of the pound against the U.S. dollar, the official rate is pegged to the SDR within a ±9% band. Before the political instability in 2011, the pound showed limited volatility against a composite including the SDR basket of currencies (euro, pound sterling, U.S. dollar, Japanese yen), although the U.S. dollar had a larger weight than in the SDR basket. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite. Following the political crisis, a parallel foreign exchange market emerged in early April 2011, diverging from the official rate by about 15%. The exchange rate in the parallel market moved erratically, reaching a high of LS 105 per U.S. dollar in March 2012. During this time, the CBS gradually adjusted the official rate toward convergence with the market rate. On March 10, 2012, the CBS announced that it would trade foreign currency with money dealers at rates other than the official rate published in its daily bulletin. This new price list, called the “intervention list,” is much closer to market prices and has helped ease pressure on the market and bring the market rate closer to the official rate. Given the developments in the official rate, the emergence of the parallel market, and the newly implemented intervention rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective April 1, 2011."
2011,923,Tajikistan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, with no predetermined path. The exchange rate of the somoni is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, in which the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) may intervene to limit exchange rate volatility. The NBT presents information on the volume of its purchase and sale transactions in foreign exchange on a daily basis. From March through September 2011, the somoni followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement against the U.S. dollar from a stabilized arrangement, effective March 1, 2011. Beginning in late September 2011, the somoni stabilized against the U.S. dollar around a new level and has remained in a narrow band. Accordingly, effective September 28, 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from a crawl-like arrangement."
2011,738,Tanzania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bank of Tanzania (BOT) is the predominant supplier of foreign exchange in a rather shallow market. It has been almost exclusively on the selling side in the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM), in order to sterilize liquidity generated by government spending financed by official inflows. The amount of the BOTʹs foreign exchange sales has varied to avoid disruptive exchange rate fluctuations. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The BOT, on a monthly basis, informs market participants of the amount to be sold in the market. Information on BOT intervention is announced to market participants through the Reuters system. Under this system, commercial banks submit two-way quotes (bid and ask) in the IFEM."
2011,578,Thailand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Under the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the value of the baht is allowed to be determined by market forces, reflecting demand and supply for the baht in the foreign exchange market. However, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) will curb any excessive volatility in the value of the baht that could adversely impact national competitiveness. The BOT does not disclose information on its interventions."

The Gambia participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the dalasi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15% of the central rate; however, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures. The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange to augment international reserves and ensure market orderliness. The CBG does not publish intervention data, but all CBG transactions are communicated to market makers."

2011,866,Tonga,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. The external value of the paʹanga is determined on the basis of a weighted currency basket comprising the Australian dollar, Japanese yen, New Zealand dollar, and U.S. dollar. The basket weights are determined based on the proportions of trade with trading partners. The weights are not published. The exchange rate of the paʹanga in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) within a band of ±5%. The NRBT does not publish intervention data. Under Section 34 of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (Amendment) Act 2007, the external value of the paʹanga is determined from time to time in a manner approved by the NRBT board, after consultation with the minister of finance, having due regard for the obligations Tonga has assumed in accordance with the provisions of any international monetary agreement to which it is a party or to which it adheres. Section 35(1) of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act empowers the NRBT to set the exchange rate."
2011,369,Trinidad and Tobago,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Because the Trinidad and Tobago dollar has remained stable against the U.S. dollar, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is a stabilized arrangement. The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) occasionally publishes its intervention data in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report."
2011,744,Tunisia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, as indicated on the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) website. Effective April 18, 2012, a fixing arrangement (i.e., the average of market participantsʹ quotes) replaced the currency composite as the reference exchange rate published by the CBT. Since then, the CBT has intervened in the foreign exchange market through bilateral transactions when market quotes deviated substantially from the daily fixing rate. Previously, the CBT intervened in the foreign exchange market to keep the exchange rate stable vis-à-vis a currency composite using its own rates in response to requests from banks for quotes. The rates quoted by the CBT were based on the currency composite and updated continuously to reflect the exchange rates prevailing in the international foreign exchange markets. During the transition to the new operational framework, since September 2011, the CBT has made several adjustments to the level of the exchange rates in the basket. This resulted in the dinar following a depreciating trend vis-à-vis the basket within a margin of less than 2% through April 30, 2012. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective September 1, 2011. The CBT, effective January 1, 2011, posts the volume of transactions between authorized intermediaries (IATs) and the volume of its daily interventions in the interbank foreign exchange market on its website."
2011,186,Turkey,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lira is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market in case of unstable price movements in exchange rates. When the CBRT intervenes in the market, it may either buy or sell foreign exchange at the rates quoted by the banks directly or may intervene through an auction. The CBRT announced the general framework of the monetary and exchange rate policies envisaged for 2012 in a press release titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2012” on December 27, 2011. A strong foreign exchange reserve position was stated as the general strategy of the CBRT. After suspension of the foreign exchange buying auctions on July 25, 2011, the CBRT resumed the selling auctions, effective August 5, 2011, to be held when it is deemed necessary to provide liquidity to the market. The CBRT began to hold intraday foreign exchange selling auctions as necessary, effective January 6, 2012. At each intraday auction, US$50 million was sold and the full amount of offers received was met up to the auction amount. Effective January 25, 2012, the CBRT suspended the regular foreign exchange selling auctions, but continued to hold intraday foreign exchange selling auctions when deemed necessary; the maximum daily amount to be sold via intraday auctions was set as US$500 million. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The CBRT publishes the results of its daily auctions on its website."

The authorities intervene in Ugandaʹs foreign exchange market when short-term fluctuations jeopardize its orderly operation. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) publishes information on its interventions in the monthly Monetary Policy reports and the quarterly and annual reports. The information on interventions includes amounts purchased or sold through the reserve buildup program, interventions, and targeted transactions. The BOU intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market at the banksʹ quoted rates, using the best bid-ask principle. Since August 2010, the BOU has been conducting daily purchases for reserve buildup purposes, while engaging in targeted sales occasionally as deemed necessary. Effective November 4, 2011, the BOU increased the amount of the daily reserve buildup purchases to US$1 million from US$0.5 million and, subsequently to US$1.7 million from US$1 million, effective December 5, 2011, following an increase in dollar inflows due to the tight monetary policy implemented by the BOU to bring down inflation. Effective February 20, 2012, the BOU revised the reserve buildup framework from a fixed daily purchase of US$1.7 million to purchases between US$1 and US$2 million daily, in response to the sharp oscillation of the shilling during February 2012."
2011,926,Ukraine,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Pursuant to the amendments to the Law of Ukraine on the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the NBUʹs primary function is to ensure the stability of the national currency, within which the NBUʹs priority is achieving and maintaining price stability. In line with this, the NBU is shifting its efforts toward developing a more robust monetary policy framework focused on domestic price stability with greater exchange rate flexibility. Pursuant to the Memorandum on Economic and Financial Policy, and in the framework of the Stand-By Arrangement with the IMF, the NBU has increased the flexibility of the hryvnia exchange rate. In addition, a transition to a free floating exchange rate is planned as the financial system recovers and the transmission mechanisms mature. Nonetheless, the NBU has continued to influence the exchange rate without announcing a specific path or exchange rate target by intervening in the interbank foreign exchange market. During foreign exchange sale interventions, the NBU satisfies all the demand at its quoted rate. The NBU intervenes both in U.S. dollars and in other reserve currencies. Since March 2010, the hryvnia has remained stable against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar. The NBU publishes information about its foreign exchange market interventions on its website."

The secretary of the treasury is responsible for the formulation and implementation of international monetary and financial policy, including foreign exchange market intervention policy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has separate legal authority to engage in foreign exchange operations, which are conducted in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury to ensure consistency with U.S. international monetary and financial policy. The Treasury and the Fed have closely coordinated their foreign exchange operations since early 1962, when the Fed commenced such operations at the request of the Treasury. Operations are conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as fiscal agent of the United States and as the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. Interventions are reported in the Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations quarterly bulletin. Following a sharp rise in foreign exchange volatility as a result of the March 2011 earthquake in Japan, on March 18, 2011, U.S. monetary authorities participated in a coordinated G7 intervention to sell Japanese yen. The operation was divided evenly between the U.S. Treasury Departmentʹs Exchange Stabilization Fund and the Federal Reserve Systemʹs Open Market Account and coordinated with Japanese monetary authorities, the European Central Bank, and Canadian and U.K. monetary authorities."
2011,298,Uruguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the peso is determined on the basis of supply and demand, although the CBU reserves the right to intervene to cushion abrupt changes in a concentrated market of few transactions. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The CBU publishes information on intervention on its website."
2011,927,Uzbekistan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of the supply of and demand for foreign exchange (Article 15 of Law of Republic of Uzbekistan N 556-II on Foreign Exchange Regulation of December 11, 2003). The sum–U.S. dollar exchange rate is used as an operational anchor, since 90% of the countryʹs trading operations are carried out in U.S. dollars. With the aim of preventing sharp movements in the exchange rate and supporting the exchange rate level that is in line with targeted macroeconomic indicators and monetary policy, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) participates in currency trading, acting as a buyer and seller of U.S. dollars and euros. Given that the sum has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement from a crawling peg, effective April 30, 2008. This reclassification reflects only a methodological correction and does not imply a judgment that there has been an alteration in the countryʹs exchange arrangement or other policies. The change is applied retroactively to April 30, 2008, which is the date the Revised System for the Classification of Exchange Rate Arrangements became effective."
2011,846,Vanuatu,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Officially, the external value of the vatu is determined on the basis of an undisclosed transaction-weighted basket of currencies of Vanuatuʹs major trading and tourism partners, including the Australian dollar, the euro, the New Zealand dollar, the U.S. dollar, and the yen. In practice, the vatu has experienced slightly more volatility against a composite than the 2% band typical of stabilized or pegged arrangements. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2011,299,Venezuela,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The bolívar is pegged to the U.S. dollar. On January 1, 2008, a monetary reconversion process eliminated three zeros from the national currency. As a result, the bolívar–U.S. dollar exchange rate was expressed as Bs 2.14 (buying) and Bs 2.15 (selling) per U.S. dollar. On January 11, 2010, Venezuela devalued its currency from Bs 2.15 per U.S. dollar to Bs 4.30 per U.S. dollar for most imports and set a second rate of Bs 2.60 per U.S. dollar for imports of food, medicine, and machinery (priority goods). Effective January 1, 2011, the CBV unified the exchange rate at Bs 4.30 per U.S. dollar. Since June 4, 2010, the parallel market has been replaced with the SITME, a bond swap mechanism operated by the CBV. The implicit rate at the bond swap market was established at Bs 5.30 per U.S. dollar by the CBV beginning June 9, 2010, the first day of transactions in the SITME."
2011,582,Vietnam,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The official exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange market demand and supply with State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) management in order to implement monetary policy objectives, curb inflation, and ensure economic stability and social security. Effective February 11, 2011, the SBV devalued the dong by increasing the average interbank exchange rate by 9.3% against the U.S. dollar and narrowed the transaction band to ±1% from ±3%. In response, the interbank rate initially converged into the official band, but has since shifted slightly outside the initial band while remaining stable around this new level. Adjustments to the official rate often follow movements of the interbank rate. Because of the stability of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The SBV does not release its intervention data."
2011,474,Yemen,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been free floating since July 1996. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) receives most of the foreign exchange proceeds of the country, particularly crude oil export revenues, official loans, and official development assistance. Faced with falling reserves, on June 1, 2009, the CBY reverted from an open window on foreign exchange sales (at a steady rate of about Yrls 200 per U.S. dollar) to periodic auctions, which allowed some depreciation of the rial. After a gradual depreciation of 9% against the U.S. dollar during the first half of 2010, the rial experienced an additional drop of more than 6% in July alone followed by a rapid 10% appreciation in August. From September 2010 through mid-February 2011, the exchange rate remained stable at about Yrls 214–215 per U.S. dollar, mainly due to CBY measures to mitigate speculative activity in the foreign exchange market and the CBYʹs policy of providing banks with foreign exchange to finance imports of essential commodities. From February to June 2011 the dollar gained some 12% against the rial as a result of the political crisis. After that, the rial-dollar rate declined slightly and stabilized at about Yrls 235–240. In early December, the dollar fell sharply to about Yrls 225 owing to the formation of the new coalition government, a reduction in the intensity of the political crisis, and less unrest. As of April 19, 2012, the spread between the official and market rates fell below 0.35%. Due to the erratic behavior of the exchange rate, which is managed yet unstable, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2011,754,Zambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is floating. The official exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The BOZ intervenes in the market primarily through transactions with ADs, which are all registered commercial banks. BOZ interventions in the market are published as historical data, and its foreign exchange transactions are published in the fortnightly statistics."
2011,698,Zimbabwe,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The Zimbabwe dollar stopped being used as the domestic currency for economic, financial, and administrative purposes over the period 2011–12. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender."
2012,512,Afghanistan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market through twice-weekly selling auctions. The results are published on the DAB website. The DAB deals with ADs only through the auction. The primary goal of these auctions is to regulate the growth of reserve money and/or currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction exchange rate volatility. Given the flexibility in the Afghani–U.S. dollar exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2012,914,Albania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lek is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) is not usually active in this market. In accordance with its regulations, intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) Severe and adverse movement in the exchange rate of the lek: These are cases of excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market and are considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementation of Monetary Policy, which seeks to avoid intervening in the market. However, lack of depth in the market and pronounced seasonal factors (i.e., seasonal increases in the supply of foreign currency in the summer months and in December and stronger imports during the first part of the year) can result in fast one-way movement, which may disrupt activity in the domestic foreign exchange market. The bid-ask spreads may widen up to 1%, and at times banks do not deal with each other at all. In such circumstances, intervention may be used to restore calm to a disorderly market and to smooth the seasonal trends. (2) Considerable exchange rate misalignment with fundamentals: The lek is considered misaligned with fundamentals if there is a lengthy overshooting of the exchange rate. (3) Effective January 16, 2012, the authorities adopted a policy to accumulate an adequate level of foreign reserves in the medium term that would cover more than four months of imports and the short-term external debt of the country. Previously, the BOA intervened in order to meet the net international reserves target, which was included each year in its monetary program. When the BOA intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange markets, its counterparties are the commercial banks; when necessary, it may carry out its intervention with foreign exchange bureaus. The BOA intervenes through (1) verbal intervention, in the form of press releases in the print or electronic media and/or press conferences; and (2) transactional intervention. The intervention exchange rate is determined by commercial banksʹ quotes and the BOA Monetary Operations Departmentʹs quotes. When the intervention exchange rate is uniform for all counterparties, the BOA publishes that rate on its Reuters page and simultaneously communicates the rate to commercial banks that do not participate in the Reuters system and to foreign exchange bureaus with which it has contact. When different exchange rates are used, the BOA announces only the fact that it has intervened; it publishes with a three-month lag the amount of the intervention in a quarterly bulletin that summarizes its foreign exchange operations with banks and the public sector. In order to raise the level of foreign reserves, the BOA purchased €10 million over eight days from January through August 2012. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2012,612,Algeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Bank of Algeria (BA) does not announce the path of the exchange rate. The external value of the dinar is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the BA is the main seller because of significant inflows related to commodity exports, including hydrocarbons, which, under current law, must be surrendered to the BA. The BA manages the dinar with reference to a basket of currencies, and the rate of the dinar relative to the currencies in the basket is based on balance of payments data. The BA has not set a target range for fluctuation of the dinar outside or within any particular band, and the observed exchange rate movements do not confirm any constant weights of the currency composite. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BA does not disclose information about its interventions."
2012,614,Angola,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; however, the BNA intervenes in the foreign exchange market by holding foreign exchange auctions. The BNA receives taxes in foreign currency paid by oil companies to the government, which it sells exclusively through its auctions. Through these auctions, the BNA influences the exchange rate. Since November 2010, the fluctuation in kwanzas has remained within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with a one-time adjustment in September 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The BNA publishes the auctions results and respective reference rate."
2012,311,Antigua and Barbuda,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Antigua and Barbuda participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2012,213,Argentina,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, and the exchange rate of the peso, which is determined in the MULC by supply and demand, applies to all transactions in foreign exchange and foreign currency banknotes. The BCRA intervenes in the foreign exchange market to carry out its reserve accumulation and management policy, which acts as a stabilizer during temporary changes in conditions. The BCRA makes no explicit or implicit commitment with respect to the exchange rate level or path. BCRA participation in the foreign exchange market was 9.4% in 2012, compared with 11.1% in 2011. In 2012, the peso continued to follow a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% margin. Market supply and demand play a role in determining the exchange rate, as does official action based on the observed path of the rate and intervention in the spot and forward foreign exchange markets. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BCRA publishes its net purchases in a weekly foreign exchange report."
2012,911,Armenia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. Since March 3, 2009, the Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) has limited its role as a supplier in the foreign exchange market to allow the exchange rate to find a level more in line with existing macroeconomic fundamentals. The CBA intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility, which is defined as short-term high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by speculative or trend-following elements rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals, which impose significant costs on the economy. The CBA intervenes only anonymously through the stock exchange, but it may also intervene openly in the interbank market. The CBA publishes weekly intervention data on its website with a one-week lag. Reflecting exchange rate developments, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2012,314,Aruba,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The legal documents that established the fixed exchange rate arrangement are AB 1992 No. GT 6 State Decree for Fixing Parity of the Aruban florin and Notice on Foreign Exchange Transactions 90/A2.
2012,193,Australia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"Both the de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as free floating. However, the RBA retains discretionary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market and has done so during periods of significant market disorder and/or gross misalignment of the exchange rate. Given the high level of development of the Australian foreign exchange market, interventions have been rare. The most recent period of intervention was in 2007–08 and was in response to episodes of significant market disorder—that is, instances where market volatility was impaired to such a degree that it was clear that the observed volatility was excessive. The RBA may also vary the way intervention is conducted; it may enter the interbank foreign exchange market directly through the voice or electronic brokerage markets or use an agent bank. As a matter of government policy, wholesale purchases of foreign currency by government agencies are made through the RBA. The RBA manages the flows from purchases on behalf of the government so as to minimize their market impact—for example, by executing these trades when the market is liquid and, if necessary, breaking up the required purchases into a series of smaller transactions. Monthly purchases and sales of foreign exchange are published on the RBA website. Daily data on foreign exchange market interventions are published on the RBA website annually, following the release of the RBA Annual Report."
2012,122,Austria,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Austria participates in a currency union (EMU) with 16 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2012,912,Azerbaijan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. A bilateral peg against the U.S. dollar was adopted in January 2011. The CBA influences the market exchange rate by intervening in the foreign exchange market to maintain the official rate within a prescribed corridor. This corridor is not announced. The CBA publishes its foreign exchange intervention data quarterly. As a result of official action, the manat has remained stable vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as stabilized."
2012,419,Bahrain,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rate is published in the Official Gazette of the CBB.
2012,513,Bangladesh,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating since May 31, 2003. The Bangladesh Bank (BB) intervenes on a limited basis in the foreign exchange market to contain undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Following a sharp depreciation of the taka against the U.S. dollar in 2011, the exchange rate was relatively stable from March through November 2012, owing to improved balance of payments conditions and periodic intervention by the BB, and since December 2012, the taka began to appreciate as a result of increased foreign exchange inflows, albeit with limited volatility. Given these brief periods of stability, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BB publishes information on its interventions in its periodic publications (e.g., Annual Report)."
2012,316,Barbados,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The minister of finance, after consultation with the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), pegged the Barbados dollar to the U.S. dollar on July 5, 1975, pursuant to the Exchange Control Act and the Central Bank of Barbados Act. Intervention data are published in Economic and Financial Statistics Section H, Table 2."
2012,913,Belarus,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed floating regime. Pursuant to the Resolution of the Board of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) on the Amendment of Certain Legal Regulatory Acts of the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (No. 446 of October 17, 2011), a managed floating regime was established, under which the rubel exchange rate is minimally influenced by direct NBRB participation but responds to the demand and supply of foreign currency under the influence of fundamental macroeconomic factors. Accordingly, NBRB currency interventions must be narrowly focused and aim exclusively to smooth sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate. Since announcing the introduction of a managed floating regime, the NBRB has used official intervention only to smooth excessive fluctuation. Due to the limited flexibility of the rubel, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The NBRB does not publish data on its interventions."
2012,124,Belgium,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Belgium participates in a currency union (EMU) with 16 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender.

2012,339,Belize,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Belize dollar is officially pegged to the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, at the rate of BZ$1 per US$0.5, as established by the Central Bank Act. The Central Bank of Belize (CBB) does not publish its intervention data."
2012,638,Benin,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Benin participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2012,514,Bhutan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. No current legal documents establish a fixed exchange rate arrangement; the ngultrum has been pegged at par to the Indian rupee since the introduction of the ngultrum in 1974. As per the Royal Monetary Authority Act of Bhutan 2010 (Provisions 88 and 89), the government, on recommendation of the RMA, may declare the external value of the ngultrum and the RMA will determine the appropriate external value. The RMA does not publish the intervention data."
2012,218,Bolivia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling peg to the U.S. dollar (also called a “sliding” rate officially) and is characterized by small movements that are not announced in advance. The Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) determines the floor price on the daily competitive foreign exchange auction (bolsín) in which the financial system participates. The CBB ensures that the rate is consistent with moderate inflation, thus mitigating external and internal inflation pressure, since the exchange rate is still used as a benchmark for the price of nontradable goods, albeit to a decreasing extent. Within the scope of the official crawling peg exchange rate regime, in an external environment characterized by marked exchange rate volatility and decreasing external inflation, the sliding rate was set at zero. Consequently, the boliviano stabilized anew against the U.S. dollar in November 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been retroactively reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from a crawling peg, effective November 2, 2011. However, the change is reflected as of January 1, 2012, corresponding to the first day of the period covered in this yearʹs Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions. The authorities consider that the de facto stabilized arrangement does not fully characterize CBB's exchange rate administration as the official policy of crawling peg has not changed. CBB's crawling peg mechanism allows the sliding rate to be set to zero without any regime change if the underlying economic fundamentals warrant it to be so. The CBB publishes data on its exchange market interventions and foreign exchange purchases and sales in the “Weekly Statistics” section of its website."
2012,963,Bosnia and Herzegovina,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The CB covers base money with its foreign reserves, including currency in circulation and commercial bank deposits. The Law on the Central Bank, adopted by the Parliamentary Assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, guarantees convertibility of the currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are no restrictions on the purchase and sale of foreign exchange. The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) does not publish data on its sales and purchases."
2012,616,Botswana,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The official exchange rate of the pula is determined according to a weighted basket of currencies composed of the SDR and the South African rand, constituting a 45% and 55% share of the basket, respectively. The rate of crawl is set as the difference between the Bank of Botswanaʹs (BOBʹs) inflation objective and the inflation forecast in major trading partner countries. The crawl rate is thus determined using a forward-looking approach and is revised regularly. In this approach, the authorities periodically determine the rate of crawl for the subsequent period, such as the next 6 or 12 months (the current rate of crawl is 0.16%)."
2012,223,Brazil,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The exchange rate of the real is determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) intervenes to smooth out excessive volatility. Intervention data are available in the CBBʹs weekly publication on currency flows on the CBB website.
2012,516,Brunei Darussalam,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD) issues Brunei dollars and manages the Currency Fund. Under the Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA), signed in 1967, which remains in effect between the AMBD and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the monetary authorities agree to the mutual exchange of their currency at par without charge. Government authorities and banks must accept each otherʹs currency at par, and the currencies are customary tender in both countries. Excess currency is repatriated regularly, with the cost borne by the currency-issuing authority. The AMBD must ensure that reserves in the Currency Fund cover at least 100% of the currency in circulation. The AMBD publishes data on the reserves used to cover the currency in circulation in the AMBDʹs annual report."
2012,918,Bulgaria,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board, which was introduced by the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) of 1997. The lev was fixed (pegged) initially to the German mark and subsequently to the euro. The 1997 law was a conceptually new legal act, introducing the currency board mechanism, and cannot be considered an amendment to the previous law of the same name, which was in effect until 1997 and repealed by the new law. Aggregate data for daily euro/lev turnover between the BNB and local banks are published on Reuters page NBOB3. Yearly aggregates are available in the annual report."
2012,748,Burkina Faso,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Burkina Faso participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2012,618,Burundi,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Burundi franc exchange rate, which was determined mainly by the BRB auction, depreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar in the first half of 2011, while remaining in the stabilized band. Since July 2011, after departing from the stabilized band, the exchange rate has shown more flexibility. Particularly since the BRB reformed the MESD on March 12, 2012, the franc began depreciating more rapidly in 2012. During 2012, the franc depreciated by 14.4%. This depreciation accelerated in early 2013, prompting the BRB to adopt a series of measures to slow the depreciation, against a backdrop of declining foreign exchange reserves. Among these measures (see Section III.H.1.a.3 Auction), a BRB sale of nearly US$9 million on March 1, 2013, reversed the depreciation trend by lowering the reference exchange rate from FBu 1,724.27 per U.S. dollar on March 1, 2013, to FBu 1,569.2 per U.S. dollar on March 4, 2013. Effective April 12, 2013, the BRB replaced the MESD, which had lost symmetry, with the MID. Only the BRB was intervening in the MESD despite the assumption that it was driven by commercial banks, with BRB intervention purely as a last resort. To encourage banks to exchange currencies and promote the interbank market, the BRB acted to prevent exchange bureaus from procuring foreign exchange from commercial banks. The new regulations governing the MID allow the BRB to intervene on its own initiative in accordance with market conditions. Given the focus of the BRB on exchange rate stability, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. Data on BRB interventions are not published."
2012,522,Cambodia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. Given the high degree of financial dollarization, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to accommodate demand for riels and maintain exchange rate stability. There was a marginal adjustment in the path of the riel–U.S. dollar exchange rate in 2012, but the riel remained stable. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Detailed intervention data are available only on request."
2012,622,Cameroon,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. Cameroon participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CAEMC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (“Joint Monetary Committee”) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to renounce the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member from the BEAC automatically results in that memberʹs renunciation of the MCA."
2012,156,Canada,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, with the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar determined on the basis of supply and demand. However, in accordance with an intervention policy established by the government in close consultation with the Bank of Canada (BOC), the BOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market on behalf of the federal government to counter disruptive short-term movements in the exchange rate, if necessary. Canadaʹs current policy is to intervene in foreign exchange markets on a discretionary, rather than a systematic, basis and only in the most exceptional circumstances. The last time the BOC intervened in the foreign exchange market was as part of the concerted intervention to counter excessive strength in the yen following the March 2011 earthquake in Japan. When an intervention occurs, an announcement is made on the BOCʹs website and the amount of the intervention is in the governmentʹs monthly official press release on international reserves."

2012,228,Chile,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate of the peso is freely determined in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Chile (CBC) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market, in exceptional circumstances, to keep the currency near its equilibrium value in order to avoid costly future reversals. These interventions take the form of transparent, well-founded measures, including explicit definitions of the periods and amounts involved and clearly explained reasons for the intervention. The CBC usually announces the amount of foreign exchange it intends to buy or sell in its monthly bulletin. It publishes its auction results daily and its reserves weekly. The CBC did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2012."
2012,924,China,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"China officially maintains a de jure managed floating exchange rate arrangement with a view to keeping the RMB exchange rate stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies to preserve the stability of the Chinese economy and financial markets. In 2012, the Peopleʹs Bank of China (PBC) renewed its commitment to promoting price discovery and further enhancing the flexibility of the RMB by allowing for increased fluctuation in both directions. To this end, effective April 16, 2012, the floating band of the RMBʹs trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market was widened from 0.5% to 1%—i.e., on each business day, the trading prices of the RMB against the U.S. dollar in the market may fluctuate within a band of ±1% around the central parity released that day by the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. Since the PBC announced a more flexible exchange rate regime in June 2010 to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, the exchange rate has varied slightly more than previously. Given that the RMB remained within the 2% margin against a trend through April 30, 2013, after a brief period of stability during early 2012, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The PBC does not publish its intervention data."
2012,233,Colombia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. All foreign exchange transactions are conducted at a market-determined exchange rate; however, the Banco de la República (The Bank of the Republic—BR) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to adjust the level of international reserves, limit excess volatility of the exchange rate, and influence the speed of adjustment of the nominal exchange rate. The BRʹs interventions are based on the guidelines established by its board of directors. The daily and monthly results of the BRʹs intervention in the foreign exchange market and information regarding each auction are available on its website. During 2012, the BR suspended the options auction mechanism and resumed daily foreign exchange purchase auctions on the spot market and continued the purchases throughout the year (for more detailed information on the auctions, see III.H.1.a.3: Auction)."
2012,632,Comoros,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The Comoros participates in the franc zone area. The Comorian franc is pegged to the euro at the fixed rate of Comorian francs 491.96775 per euro; the value of other currencies is determined on the basis of this fixed rate and on the basis of the exchange rates of these currencies in the foreign exchange markets. The exchange rate arrangement is established by the following documents: (1) the monetary cooperation agreement between the Comorian and French governments of November 23, 1979; (2) the decision by the European Council of Ministers authorizing France to maintain its monetary arrangements with both the CFA zone countries and the Comoros of November 23, 1998; and (3) the order by the governor of the Central Bank of Comoros (CBC) on euro-Comorian franc parity of January 14, 1999. Decree No. 87-005/PR, Regulating Financial Relations between the Comoros and Other Countries, and its implementing regulations apply. Changes to the exchange rate arrangement may be decided by the government of either the Comoros or France, after notifying the other party to the agreement."
2012,238,Costa Rica,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Since October 17, 2006, the de jure exchange rate arrangement has been classified as a crawling band arrangement. In 2012, the Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR) remained committed to maintain the band, in order to continue the gradual and orderly transition to a floating exchange rate arrangement. The band is defined in terms of colones per U.S. dollar and does not include a central parity. Since January 2009, the crawl rate of the bandʹs upper bound (intervention selling exchange rate) has been C 0.20 per U.S. dollar a business day with the lower bound (intervention purchasing exchange rate) constant at C 500.00 per U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2012, the intervention selling exchange rate reached C 762.05, indicating a band with a width of 52.5% with the lower bound as the basis. Effective January 25, 2012, in order to reinforce the economyʹs “financial shield,” the board of directors of the BCCR agreed to implement a program to accumulate foreign exchange reserves between February 1, 2012, and December 31, 2013, by purchasing up to US$1,500 million in foreign exchange in the Foreign Exchange Market (MONEX). In 2012, the BCCR purchased US$1,369.4 million, and subsequently reached the program ceiling by January 11, 2013. Of the total amount, 96.5% was purchased to maintain the lower bound of the exchange rate band, and 82.6% was purchased in the last four months of 2012. Since mid-April 2012, the colon–U.S. dollar exchange rate remained within a 2% band vis-à-vis the lower bound of the exchange rate band and has occasionally been at the lower bound level itself, prompting the BCCR to intervene to prevent the local currency from appreciating further. Given the stability of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been retroactively reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective April 16, 2012."
2012,662,Côte dʹIvoire,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Côte dʹIvoire participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2012,960,Croatia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating without a predetermined path. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) may set intervention exchange rates, which it applies in transactions with banks to limit exchange rate volatility. The CNB conducts foreign exchange auctions on a discretionary basis to ensure the stability of the kuna and provide liquidity for payments domestically and abroad (described under Section H.1.a.3. Auctions). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. Intervention data (prices and volume) are published on the CNB website."
2012,354,Curaçao and Sint Maarten,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. Official buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are set daily on the basis of rates of the U.S. dollar abroad.

2012,423,Cyprus,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Cyprus participates in a currency union (EMU) with 16 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro floats freely and independently against other currency. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2012,935,Czech Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The external value of the koruna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) participates. Effective November 1, 2012, the CNB suspended sales of foreign exchange reserve revenues, which were aimed at preventing a continued rise in the reserve level, and began to publish its monthly foreign exchange transaction data on its website, with a two-month lag. Except for its program of regular sales, the CNB last intervened in September 2002. It used only local market makers and traded at their rates. In addition to CNB participation in the foreign exchange market, there are off-market conversions of EU transfers and, in the past, there were conversions of large privatization receipts. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. Effective September 27, 2012, the CNB announced additional monetary easing in the context of the inflation targeting framework in the form of foreign exchange interventions, given that the interest rate was at the zero lower bound. As of April 30, 2013, the CNB has not used this intervention tool."
2012,636,Democratic Republic of the Congo,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Congo franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The BCC, while observing the international reserves target in its monetary program, intervenes to channel back to the market some of the reserves accumulated from external flows and to prevent the sharpest fluctuations, as measured by a daily fluctuation of ±1.5% in the U.S. dollar–franc rate. Intervention takes place through an auction, which is the only operational framework for the BCCʹs transactions with the market. The BCC has intervened on both sides of the market. After departure from the stabilized band in November 2011, with increased flexibility for several months, the Congo franc stabilized anew against the U.S. dollar in early January 2012. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been retroactively reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from other managed, effective January 1, 2012."
2012,128,Denmark,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The formal framework for the Danish fixed exchange rate policy is the ERM II. Denmark participates in the ERM II with a central rate of DKr 746.038 per €100. The central rate is a conversion of the central rate vis-à-vis the deutsche mark before the third stage of the EMU and was last adjusted in January 1987. Denmark has entered into an agreement with the ECB and the euro area member countries on a narrower fluctuation band of ±2.25%. In recent years, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) has consistently maintained a stable krone within less than 1% of the central rate. The DNʹs net purchase or sale of foreign currency during a month is published at 4:00 p.m. on the second working day of the following month in the Foreign Exchange and Liquidity press release. The agreement on Denmarkʹs fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro within a narrow fluctuation band of ±2.25% around the central rate in ERM II was concluded at an informal meeting of the Ecofin Council of September 25–27, 1998, in Vienna, between the ministers for economy and finance and the CB governors of the EU member countries."
2012,611,Djibouti,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"Djiboutiʹs monetary system is based on a currency board. The Djibouti franc has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1949, but the legislation establishing the currency board and determining the fixed exchange rate is Law No. 118/AN/11/6èmeL of January 22, 2011. The Central Bank of Djibouti (BCD) guarantees and provides for unlimited conversion into U.S. dollars of banknotes and coins used as legal tender in Djibouti. The full issue of Djibouti francs is covered by foreign exchange reserves. The National Assembly of Djibouti has the authority to make decisions regarding changes in the exchange rate arrangement."
2012,321,Dominica,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Dominica participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2012,243,Dominican Republic,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) aims to increase the flexibility of the exchange rate alongside the implementation of the inflation-targeting framework formally adopted in 2012. The CBDR intervenes in the foreign exchange market to avoid instances of excessive exchange rate volatility that might give rise to distortions in decisions taken by economic agents. Since February 2010, the peso has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%. There was a slight increase in the rate of depreciation from September 2012 through March 2013, while the exchange rate remained in a 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBDR publishes data on foreign exchange sales and purchases in the foreign exchange market by different institutional actors (banks, exchange houses, and remittance houses). The data are published on a gross (all transactions) basis and a net basis (excluding interbank operations). The CBDR does not disclose data on its volume of foreign exchange transactions with banks."

2012,469,Egypt,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate is determined through supply and demand in the foreign exchange interbank market, in which the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) buys and sells foreign exchange daily at the prevailing rate. The CBE does not publish its intervention data. Following a period of stability against the U.S. dollar, the pound, in mid-November 2011, started on a depreciating trend against the dollar within a margin of less than 2% with a one-time adjustment in January 2013. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective November 10, 2011. On December 30, 2012, the CBE introduced a multiple price auction mechanism to buy and sell foreign exchange. The CBE announces the total amount sold, weighted average rate, and cutoff price after each auction. After significant depreciation during the first auction sessions, the pound has been depreciating against the dollar more rapidly."

On January 1, 2001, the U.S. dollar became unrestricted legal tender with unlimited redeemability for the settlement of debt in El Salvador. The U.S. dollar is used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange. The Central Reserve Bank (CRB) must exchange colones in circulation for U.S. dollars at banksʹ request at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per U.S. dollar."

2012,962,Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Under the Foreign Exchange Law, the denar exchange rate is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) participates in the foreign exchange market in order to maintain a stable exchange rate with narrow fluctuation band of bid and ask exchange rates determined by the Committee for Operational Monetary Policy. Thus, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The NBRM publishes data on daily turnover of the foreign exchange market, which also includes information on NBRM intervention.

2012,915,Georgia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Georgia is floating. In line with the official policy, the NBG has remained committed to improving functioning of the foreign exchange market and enhancing exchange rate flexibility since it introduced a multiple price foreign exchange auction in March 2009 and completely phased out its direct intervention to influence the price of the lari in the market in May 2009. The NBG intervenes in the foreign exchange market through foreign exchange auctions, but does not make any explicit or implicit commitment with respect to an exchange rate target or path. In the first half of 2012, the foreign exchange purchase auctions moderated, with a cumulative volume of US$75 million. However, since July 2012, the NBP has intensified the foreign exchange auctions both in volume and frequency and has been active on both sides of the market, with total purchases of US$340 million and total sales of US$65 million through April 2013. Most of this activity took place since December 2012, coinciding with increased appreciation pressure on the lari: foreign exchange purchase auctions have been directed toward rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, an objective of the authoritiesʹ economic program that is supported by an IMF stand-by arrangement. Although foreign exchange interventions account for a small portion of annual foreign exchange market turnover, the size of these interventions on any given day is substantial. Since July 2012, the lari has remained stable against the U.S. dollar in a 2% band. Market supply and demand play a role in determining the exchange rate, as does official action based on the observed path of the rate and the discretionary nature of the foreign exchange auctions. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified from floating to a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar, effective July 1, 2012. With respect to intervention data, the volume sold at the NBGʹs foreign exchange auctions and the average exchange rates are posted on the NBG website immediately after each auction."

2012,258,Guatemala,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. In accordance with the Monetary Law and the Free Foreign Exchange Convertibility Law, Guatemala has a flexible exchange rate arrangement under which the rate is determined in the foreign exchange market by supply and demand. However, the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the nominal exchange rate, without affecting its trend. The BOG intervenes through foreign exchange auctions based on a transparent rule, which limits daily volatility. Effective December 28, 2012, the fluctuation margin (added to or subtracted from the five-day moving average of the exchange rate) used to determine whether the BOG may intervene was increased from 0.6% to 0.65%. The BOG may also intervene on a discretionary basis whenever the nominal exchange rate shows unusual volatility. From January 1, 2012, through December 31, 2012, the BOG purchased $109.2 million (on 21 occasions) and sold $249.5 million (on 21 occasions). After a period of relative stability from June 2011 through early March 2012, the quetzal showed increased flexibility against the U.S. dollar without an ascertainable path for the exchange rate. Accordingly, effective March 13, 2012, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement. Intervention data are publicly available on the BOGʹs website."
2012,656,Guinea,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Guinea announced its participation in the exchange rate mechanisms (ERM and ERM II) of the WAMZ, which formally limits the fluctuation of the franc to ±15% around a central rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, but this has yet to be implemented. The Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea (CBRG) intervenes once a week through a foreign exchange auction market with active commercial banks. However, a structural excess demand of foreign exchange is not reflected in the exchange rate set during the weekly auctions. Transactions of commercial banks with their customers must remain within a band of ±3% around the last weekly auction rate. Given the frequent changes in the foreign exchange operational framework, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The CBRG regularly publishes information regarding foreign exchange market interventions."
2012,654,Guinea-Bissau,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg.

The Bank of Guyana (BOG) periodically purchases foreign currency from cambio dealers in order to maintain international reserves at acceptable levels. In accordance with bilateral agreements with the CARICOM CBs, the BOG quotes weekly rates for certain CARICOM currencies. Reflecting the stability of the Guyana dollar against the U.S. dollar as a result of interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2012,263,Haiti,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Due to the depreciating trend the gourde has followed against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been classified as a crawl-like arrangement since April 2008, except for a disruption in the exchange rate market after the January 2010 earthquake, during which the gourde was classified as other managed arrangement for a short period from January through February 2010. From mid-July 2012 to mid-April 2013, the gourde followed the U.S. dollar within a tighter margin of ±0.2% around the trend, however showed limited volatility within a 2% band since then. Foreign exchange sales and purchases by the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) are used for smoothing exchange rate fluctuations. The BRH publishes information on foreign exchange interventions weekly on its website."
2012,268,Honduras,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling band. The exchange rate of the lempira is determined by foreign exchange auctions of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). The BCH maintains an operational band requiring all bid prices for the purchase of foreign exchange to be within a range of 7% above or below the base price, with such prices subject to the requirement that bids in auctions not exceed 0.075% of the average reference exchange rate (TCR) derived from auctions during the preceding seven business days. The base exchange rate is calculated weekly according to a procedure established by the BCH board of directors for this purpose, which includes the following variables: (1) the differential between the domestic inflation rate and the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners, (2) changes in the exchange rates of these countriesʹ currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and (3) the performance of official reserve assets. The external inflation rate is considered to be the weighted average of the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners. Domestic inflation is measured by the consumer price index. The change in the U.S. dollar exchange rates of the main trading partners is measured using the effective exchange rate index, which is compiled weekly on the basis of the weighted average of the exchange rates of the main trading partners expressed in units of their respective currencies to US$1.00. Finally, an adjustment factor is applied to the base price of the auction, depending on the number of months of imports covered by the BCHʹs reserve assets. In July 2011, the BCH reactivated the crawling band system that had been in operation until mid-2005. As a result, following a long period of stability, the lempira was allowed to crawl once again in July 2011 and thereafter followed a steadily depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar, with a small one-time adjustment in November 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BCH publishes its sales of foreign exchange on its website daily."
2012,532,Hong Kong Special Administrative Region,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires that the monetary base be backed at least 100% by and that changes in it be matched 100% by corresponding changes in the reserve currency (U.S. dollar) at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75–HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—has been in place since May 18, 2005. The monetary base includes issued notes and coins, the balance at the HKMA of banksʹ clearing accounts (i.e., the aggregate balance), and outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Consistent with currency board principles, the HKMA may issue additional Exchange Fund paper when there is an inflow of funds, and the program may expand along with the interest payments on such paper. Issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which back banknotes issued by note-issuing banks (NIBs), must be made against U.S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. Issuance and withdrawal of government-issued notes and coins are settled against U.S. dollars at the same fixed rate. The legal documents that establish the currency board include the Basic Law (Chapter V, Section 1, Articles 110 and 111); the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66); and an exchange of letters between the financial secretary and the Monetary Authority specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system under the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The letters specify that the financial secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system, including the linked exchange rate. Section 3(1) of the ordinance, as amended, specifies that the Exchange Fund “shall be under the control of the Financial Secretary and shall be used primarily for such purposes as the Financial Secretary thinks fit affecting, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong SAR and for other purposes incidental thereto.” The HKMA is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments, and operational means for doing so, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary system. The HKMA makes immediate announcements of the impact on the aggregate balance due to purchases or sales of U.S. dollars by the Currency Board via various information vendors, including Reuters and Bloomberg. The information is also available on the HKMA website."
2012,944,Hungary,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating because of the discretionary interventions made by the MNB in the foreign exchange market. The possible objectives of foreign exchange intervention are listed in the MNBʹs intervention strategy, which has not been published. The strategy aims to avoid disruptive market fluctuations and exchange rate overshooting. However, the strategy emphasizes that the MNB generally refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange market. The MNB converts foreign currency for the government and net current and capital transfers from the EU on the foreign exchange market at foreign exchange market rates. These transactions change the foreign exchange reserve position of the MNB. If the resulting reserve dynamics are not in line with the MNBʹs reserve management objectives, some of the funds are channeled to the market. Transactions are conducted in small amounts at market prices. The MNB announced the policy of channeling the foreign exchange position resulting from EU transfers several times in the past. The latest announcement was in March 2009, for the year 2009. Until 2009, the net amounts were published quarterly in the MNBʹs Quarterly and Annual Reports."
2012,176,Iceland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) may intervene in the interbank foreign exchange market and has done so occasionally. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is floating. Data on the CBIʹs foreign exchange buying and selling are published daily on its website."
2012,534,India,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined in the interbank market, where the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes at times. The RBIʹs role is to modulate excessive volatility so as to maintain orderly conditions. The RBI has no fixed or preannounced target or band for the exchange rate. In its interventions, the RBI purchases and sells U.S. dollars spot and forward in the interbank market at the ongoing market rate. The RBI deals only with ADs and publishes monthly data on its interventions (foreign exchange purchases and sales) in both the spot and the forward markets in the RBI Monthly Bulletin with a one-month lag."
2012,536,Indonesia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating (adopted August 14, 1997). The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank Indonesia (BI), however, may intervene—as part of a policy mix—whenever necessary to achieve the inflation target and to maintain macroeconomic stability. When it intervenes, the BI does not target a specific rate or maintain exchange rate movements within a specific band; rather it provides liquidity to maintain market stability. The BI does not disclose data on its interventions. The rupiah showed some volatility in the first half of 2012. Since June 2012, the rupiah followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to crawl-like arrangement from floating effective June 1, 2012."
2012,433,Iraq,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has allowed the exchange rate to appreciate gradually vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar following a predetermined path. Within these limits, the exchange rate of the dinar is determined in the foreign exchange market. Since January 2009, the CBI has set the rate of crawl at zero, stabilizing the exchange rate at about ID 1,170 per U.S. dollar through January 16, 2012, and, subsequently, at about ID 1,166 per U.S. dollar, effective January 17, 2012. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar. The intervention data are published on the CBI website."
2012,178,Ireland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Ireland participates in a currency union (EMU) with 16 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2012,429,Islamic Republic of Iran,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a managed floating arrangement against a basket of currencies since 2002. The rial depreciated steadily since mid-May 2012 with the parallel market rate at exchange bureaus doubling the interbank exchange rate by the end of September. The authorities started to offer a more depreciated rate, in addition to the interbank rate available only for imports of basic goods, at the Foreign Exchange Trading Center in late September 2012, but the parallel rate continued to depreciate since November. The spread between the parallel rate and the new Foreign Exchange Trading Center rate reached 45% by end of April 2013. Because there was no discernible pattern for the rial under official guidance while the official and parallel market rates diverged significantly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2012,436,Israel,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the Bank of Israel (BOI) announced in August 2009 that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market in the event of unusual movement in the exchange rate that is inconsistent with underlying economic conditions or when conditions are disorderly. The BOI ceased its interventions in the foreign exchange market from August 2011 through March 2013. On May 13, 2013, the BOI announced a foreign exchange purchase plan to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate, estimating the total purchases to be about $2.1 billion by the end of 2013 within the framework of this plan. The BOIʹs assessments of the overall effect on the balance of payments resulting from natural gas production and foreign exchange purchases will be updated from time to time and publicized. In line with this framework, prior to the May 13 announcement, the BOI had intervened in the foreign exchange market, albeit not more than three times through the end of April. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement continues to be classified as free floating. The BOI publishes its monthly net foreign exchange purchases in a communiqué."
2012,136,Italy,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Italy participates in a currency union (EMU) with 16 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2012,343,Jamaica,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market, in which the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) intervenes frequently. Beginning in June 2011, the exchange rate was allowed to adjust on a gradual basis while official interventions in the foreign exchange market continued. As a result, the Jamaican dollar followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%, albeit at a slightly more accelerated rate since May 2012 and with a further increase in the pace in January 2013. Given the pattern of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BOJ publishes information on its interventions in its Annual Report and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report."
2012,158,Japan,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the yen is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disorderly conditions in the market. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Interventions fall within the mandate of the MOF, which publishes daily purchases and sales amounts as well as intervention currencies on its website. The Bank of Japan (BOJ), acting as agent of the minister of finance, intervenes in the market through financial institutions and/or brokers. The last time the MOF intervened in the foreign exchange market was from October 31 through November 4, 2011 (¥9,091.6 billion) to address excess volatility and disorderly exchange rate movement. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating."
2012,439,Jordan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dinar is officially pegged to the SDR, but in practice, it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since late 1995. The CBJ is responsible for maintaining the stability of the dinar exchange rate."
2012,916,Kazakhstan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float since February 2011. The main intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Intervention in the foreign exchange market seeks to smooth out demand and supply fluctuations and is prompted by second-tier banksʹ foreign exchange supply and demand. The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) may conduct foreign exchange operations both on the regulated Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) and in the interbank (OTC) foreign exchange markets. The NBK intervenes on its own behalf directly with market participants based on their quotes and does not publish information on its interventions. Since October 2009, the tenge has tracked a trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2012,664,Kenya,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. Official foreign exchange market interventions aim to moderate the rate of change and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than to establish a particular level. Data on interventions are only partially disclosed. If the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) uses the auction system to intervene, the market is informed of the amount dealt and the average rate. (The average rate is published after the auction closes.) If the CBK chooses to intervene directly (i.e., by buying or selling foreign exchange from or to banks directly through the Reuters Dealing System), the market is informed but amounts and rates are not published. In 2012, the shilling experienced relative stability with limited volatility. Given the frequency of interventions in the foreign exchange market, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2012,826,Kiribati,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. There is no central monetary institution, and the authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange. The Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Bank (Kiribati) Limited, the only commercial bank, quotes daily rates for 15 currencies on the basis of their respective rates against the Australian dollar."
2012,542,Korea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the won is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. As such, the system is managed in accordance with the principles defined by the free floating system, and the governmentʹs role is very limited to remain within the range allowed by the free floating system. However, because of the lack of information on the authoritiesʹ interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Korea (BOK) may intervene in the market with the funds of the BOK and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund when it is deemed necessary for the stability of the market. Interventions in the spot market or through derivatives in the forward market are not announced, and intervention data are not published."
2012,967,Kosovo,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The legal tender that circulates freely in Kosovo is the euro.
2012,443,Kuwait,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. According to the law of the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK), the exchange rate arrangement is specified by an “amiri” decree in consultation with the governor of the CBK (see CBK Law, Chapter I, Article II). The arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. Intervention data are not disclosed to the public."
2012,917,Kyrgyz Republic,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) participates and intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market to reduce exchange rate volatility as necessary. During 2012, the som generally followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a narrow band with periods of divergence. In line with ad hoc but frequent adjustments in the som–U.S. dollar exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The NBKR publishes its daily purchases and sales of foreign exchange on its website."
2012,544,Lao P.D.R.,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The kip has remained consistently stable vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar with a slight shift in March 2013. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2012,941,Latvia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. Latvia participates in the ERM II. The Bank of Latvia (BOL) publishes its intervention data on a weekly basis.
2012,446,Lebanon,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is free floating. In practice, the exchange rate remains within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Banque du Liban (BDL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market daily from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and from 10:00 a.m. until noon on Friday. The BDL does not publish intervention data."
2012,666,Lesotho,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The loti is pegged to the South African rand at M 1 per rand. The exchange rate is 1:1, backed by the net international reserves position of 120% of the money supply (defined as M1 in this context)."
2012,668,Liberia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to counter speculative movements. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement since November 2011, when the exchange rate departed from the stabilized band, showing increased but limited flexibility while still being managed. The foreign exchange auction data (volume, price, etc.) are published on the CBL website."
2012,672,Libya,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the SDR. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency.
2012,946,Lithuania,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board was established by the Law on Credibility of the Litas and has been in effect since April 1, 1994. The litas exchange rate against the euro was fixed by the Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania on the approbation of the proposal of the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) regarding the anchor currency and the litas official exchange rate (February 1, 2002, No. 157) and the Resolution of the Bank of Lithuania on the anchor currency and the official exchange rate of the litas (February 1, 2002, No. 15). According to the Law on Credibility of the Litas, the BOL covers all its liabilities denominated in litai with its foreign reserves. The BOL provides a foreign exchange window for commercial banks and branches of foreign credit institutions (subject to reserve requirements) at their request. The statistics of the operations conducted can be found under the section “Liquidity Situation in the Banking System” on the BOL website."
2012,137,Luxembourg,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Luxembourg participates in a currency union (EMU) with 16 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2012,674,Madagascar,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the official interbank market. The Central Bank of Madagascar (CBM) intervenes in the interbank market to smooth large exchange rate fluctuations and meet foreign reserve targets. Information on CBM daily interventions is not publicly available. Only the weighted average daily rate and the number and amount of transactions are made available to the public through the CBM official site. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating.
2012,676,Malawi,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Official intervention focuses on meeting the net foreign reserves position target and limiting exchange rate volatility and takes into account seasonal fluctuations. The Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) is a large supplier of foreign exchange in the market and is therefore able to significantly influence the official rates. Effective May 7, 2012, the RBM devalued the kwacha from MK 168 to MK 250 per U.S. dollar. In anticipation of this devaluation, the RBM took steps aimed at allowing market forces to determine the exchange rate and at improved availability of foreign exchange in the market. Accordingly, effective May 7, 2012, the RBM implemented the revised Guidelines for Foreign Exchange Trading Activities, allowing for more market determination of the exchange rate. Since then the kwacha continued to depreciate—reaching MK 416 per U.S. dollar by mid-April 2013. Given that official actions continue to play a role in influencing the exchange rate (i.e., the RBM is open to deal with commercial banks on a daily basis), the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2012,548,Malaysia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) operates a de jure managed float for the ringgit with reference to a currency basket. The composition of the basket is not disclosed. As a result of the ringgit tracking a composite, although not closely enough to be classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BNM does not publish its intervention data. The BNM may also transact directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers at the rates it deems fit for the purpose of maintaining orderly market conditions without targeting any particular level of the exchange rate."
2012,556,Maldives,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Since 2011, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. This regime allows the rufiyaa to float in a band of 20% in either direction around a central parity of Rf 12.85 per U.S. dollar. However, the rufiyaa remained stabilized in a narrow band against the U.S. dollar near the ceiling of the band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Under the Maldives Monetary Authority (MMA) Act, the president may decide on a change in the exchange rate arrangement and adjust the exchange rate."
2012,678,Mali,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Mali participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2012,181,Malta,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Malta adopted the euro on January 1, 2008. Malta participates in a currency union (EMU) with 16 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."

2012,682,Mauritania,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The ouguiya was previously de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar, at an exchange rate of UM 268.6 per U.S. dollar (from October 24, 2005 through January 25, 2007). Since 2007, the new foreign exchange market has been using a fixing system in which the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) intervenes. The BCM intervenes in order to regulate the exchange market according to its exchange rate policy objectives (smoothing the exchange rate and the projected level of official reserves). Due to the authoritiesʹ role in determining the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. A summary statement of market turnover data is updated daily on the BCM website."
2012,684,Mauritius,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand in the domestic foreign exchange market. Interventions by the BOM in the foreign exchange market are limited to smoothing volatility and do not aim to offset market forces. Because the BOM intervenes in the foreign exchange market, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Information regarding interventions is published regularly on the BOM website and in its publications."
2012,273,Mexico,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the peso is determined in the foreign exchange market. On November 29, 2011, the Bank of Mexico (BOM) announced that starting November 30, it would auction up to US$400 million daily at a minimum price 2% higher (1.02 times Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar) than the weighted average of the previous dayʹs auction sale price in the event of a 2% depreciation from the previous dayʹs price. As of April 30, 2013, this mechanism had been used three times (May 23, May 31, and July 23, 2012), for a total of US$646 million. The BOM reserves the right to make extraordinary sales of foreign exchange if necessary due to market conditions. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating given that there were only three interventions."
2012,868,Micronesia,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Micronesia is the U.S. dollar. The authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange.
2012,921,Moldova,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Moldova (NBM) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the leu against the U.S. dollar. Sharp fluctuations are not specifically defined; however, the NBM intervenes based on market conditions and future expectations of market participants. These interventions do not aim to change the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM intervenes directly at the market-quoted rates and publishes aggregated monthly data on its website regarding its interventions and interbank market turnover. The data show interventions by currency and type of operation (spot or derivative)."
2012,948,Mongolia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The BOM reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market using the U.S. dollar as the principal intervention currency. The BOM intervenes through the auction to limit day-to-day exchange rate volatility in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. The BOM publishes the cutoff rate for each auction on its website.
2012,943,Montenegro,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The euro is legal tender.
2012,686,Morocco,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a composite. Since April 2001, the basket has been composed of the euro and the U.S. dollar, with weights of 80% and 20%, respectively. The Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) publishes its monthly foreign exchange purchases and sales on its website. Authority to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is found in Dahir No. 1-05-38 of November 23, 2005, promulgating Law No. 76-03 establishing the charter of the Bank Al-Maghrib (Chapter II, Missions, Section I, Core missions, Article 8)."
2012,688,Mozambique,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. As a major conduit for foreign aid flows, the Bank of Mozambique (BM) is the main channel for foreign exchange into the market. It also intervenes to smooth seasonal fluctuations. For its transactions in Mozambiqueʹs interbank foreign exchange market (MCI) the BM uses the quotes shown on the screen for each commercial bank. The BM is therefore a price taker—i.e., it takes the highest foreign exchange selling rate and the lowest buying rate. The BM publishes information on its website regarding foreign exchange transactions in the MCI. It also publishes the schedule of MCI benchmark average exchange rates in the Jornal Notícias and on its website."
2012,518,Myanmar,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a managed float from a conventional peg to the SDR at K 8.50847 per SDR, effective April 2, 2012. According to a CBM announcement, the value of the kyat is determined by the financial markets, but the CBM may intervene to mitigate undue exchange rate volatility and support kyat liquidity in the foreign exchange market. The CBM has no predetermined target for the kyat exchange rate or its trading range and expects the value to fluctuate with supply and demand in the market consistent with the expectations of a floating exchange rate regime. Since April 1, 2012, there has been progress toward a unified exchange rate: the divergence among the formal and informal market rates converged within a narrow range of each other by the end of 2012. The CBM has also widened the trading band in the wholesale market from ±0.3% to ±0.8% of the CBM reference rate. Due to the limited flexibility of the exchange rate and irregular patterns (brief periods of stability within a 2% band), the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2012,728,Namibia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement is the CMA agreement.
2012,558,Nepal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. Nepal Rastra Bank Act No. 2058(2002) authorizes the Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) to establish Nepalʹs exchange rate arrangement. The NRB publishes its intervention data regularly.

2012,196,New Zealand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the New Zealand dollar is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may intervene if the exchange rate is exceptionally high or low, if that rate is not justified by economic fundamentals, and if there is a material prospect that the intervention will influence the exchange rate. Interventions may not be used as an attempt to influence the long-term trend of the exchange rate. There was an increase in the volume of net NZD sold by the RBNZ since November 2012, continuing through April 2013. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from free floating, effective November 1, 2012. Based on a speech delivered by the RBNZ governor on May 30, 2013, the RBNZ undertook foreign exchange transactions to dampen some of the spikes in the exchange rate in the earlier months and the RBNZ is prepared to scale up foreign exchange activities if there are opportunities to have greater influence. The RBNZ publishes information on its foreign currency assets and liabilities, including its foreign currency intervention capacity (stock of reserves available for foreign exchange intervention) and foreign exchange swap position, on its website but does not publish data on its direct intervention."
2012,278,Nicaragua,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The Central Bank of Nicaragua (CBN) publishes aggregated monthly data pertaining to CBN foreign exchange transactions with the banks and the government.
2012,692,Niger,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Niger participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2012,694,Nigeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The CBN explicitly aims to maintain an exchange rate principally driven by market forces but intervenes to reduce volatility and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. The midpoint of the target exchange rate is 155 naira per U.S. dollar with a soft exchange rate band of ±3%. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The CBN publishes information on its interventions through auction on its website; however, data on interventions in the interbank market are not disseminated. Even though Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires maintaining the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar within ±15% around the central rate, the CBN has not implemented this regime."
2012,142,Norway,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the krone floats freely and independently against other currencies. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Norges Bank (NB) does not normally intervene to influence the exchange rate of the krone; however, it may intervene in the foreign exchange market on short notice if the krone deviates substantially from the level the NB considers reasonable in relation to fundamentals and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target. The NB may also intervene in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level. The NB has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999. Foreign exchange purchases for the Government Pension Fund Global are publicly preannounced on the CB website. In extraordinary circumstances, the NB may provide foreign exchange liquidity via collateralized operations. This was done between September 2008 and July 2009."
2012,449,Oman,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg to the U.S. dollar. According to the Banking Law of 1974, later amended by Royal Decree No. 114/2000, the par value of the rial Omani is determined from time to time by His Majesty the Sultan."
2012,564,Pakistan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) does not explicitly or implicitly commit to an exchange rate target or path. Market intervention has generally been directed toward building foreign exchange reserves and ensuring smooth functioning of the foreign exchange market. The SBP does not publish information regarding its intervention.
2012,565,Palau,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Palau is the U.S. dollar, which circulates freely."

2012,853,Papua New Guinea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the kina is determined in the interbank market, in which ADs participate. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to smooth extreme fluctuations; however, it does not publish information on its interventions. From mid-February 2012 through the end of December 2012, the kina remained stable against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from floating, effective February 13, 2012. In January 2013, the exchange rate departed from the stabilized band and has shown increased flexibility since. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement, effective January 1, 2013."
2012,288,Paraguay,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; the exchange rate of the guaraní is determined by supply and demand. The Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) intervenes in the exchange market to smooth the effects of undue fluctuations. The objective of the CBP under Article 3 of its Organic Law (No. 489/95) is to preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Moreover, Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the CBP aims to smooth seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. Article 47 establishes that the exchange rate is determined by market forces. The CBP publishes information on its foreign exchange interventions in the Informe Económico (Economic Report) posted each month on its website. Given the focus of the monetary authorities on exchange rate stability, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2012,293,Peru,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Peru has a de jure and de facto floating exchange rate arrangement. The exchange rate of the nuevo sol is determined by supply and demand. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) is authorized by law to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The goal of these interventions is to limit foreign exchange volatility without altering the exchange rateʹs trend. Intervention may also be conducted using dollar-indexed bonds and repos. The BCRP publishes information about interventions (prices and amounts) on its website daily. From October 2011 through mid-January 2013, the exchange rate showed limited volatility while continuing to appreciate, and since mid-January 2013 it has shown increased flexibility."
2012,566,Philippines,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) adheres to a market-determined exchange rate policy with some scope for occasional action solely to prevent potentially disruptive sharp fluctuations. The BSP does not target or support a given level of exchange rate; it allows the value of the peso to be determined by supply and demand. The BSP may participate in the U.S. dollar–peso market directly with market participants or via market makers and does not disclose intervention data, which are for internal use only. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Data on currency swaps settled in foreign currency and nondeliverable forwards settled in domestic currency are reported monthly in Sections II and IV, respectively, of the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which is posted on the BSP website."
2012,964,Poland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the zloty is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, and the zloty is traded freely against all currencies. The National Bank of Poland (NBP), however, may intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary to ensure domestic macroeconomic and financial stability, which is conducive to meeting the inflation target in the medium term. The NBP resumed interventions to stabilize the market and prevent speculation, with the first intervention on September 23, 2011, followed by several more through the end of 2011. Because the NBP intervened in more than three instances, during this time the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as floating. Given that NBP interventions ceased after December 30, 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating since then. In addition, the MOF has increased its sale of EU funds in the foreign exchange market since April 2011."
2012,182,Portugal,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Portugal participates in a currency union (EMU) with 16 other EU member countries and has no separate legal tender.

When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2012,453,Qatar,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The targeted peg was officially authorized by Amiri Decree No. 34 of 2001 issued in July 2001, replacing the de jure exchange rate policy of pegging to the SDR, which had been in effect since 1975. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) does not publish data on its interventions."
2012,634,Republic of Congo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. The Republic of Congo participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CAEMC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (“Joint Monetary Committee”) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to renounce the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that member countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2012,299,República Bolivariana de Venezuela,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The bolívar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at the unified exchange rate of Bs 4.30 per U.S. dollar.
2012,968,Romania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) may intervene to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations. There is no formal definition of excessive exchange rate fluctuations: the assessment is based on domestic and international market circumstances and on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The NBR intervenes either directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers. The NBR does not publish information on its interventions. The NBR has the authority to change the exchange rate arrangement.
2012,922,Russia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement—namely a controlled floating exchange rate arrangement. The ruble value of a dual-currency basket is used as the operating benchmark for transactions in the domestic foreign exchange market. The dual-currency basket, including the U.S. dollar and the euro, has been used by the Bank of Russia (BR) as an operating benchmark for currency interventions since 2005. Initially, the composition of the basket was €0.10 and US$0.90, but as the participants of the domestic foreign exchange market adapted to the new conditions, the BR revised its composition, increasing the euro share. The basket now is composed of €0.45 and US$0.55. The BR establishes an operational floating range of its allowable levels with automatic revisions of the boundaries depending on the volume of currency interventions. The value of the dual-currency basket is determined both by market factors and by BR interventions. Since the suspension on October 13, 2010, of the fixed exchange rate corridor for the value of the dual-currency basket (Rub 26–Rub 41 since January 2009), no target values or fixed limitations on the BR exchange rate have been established. Interventions take place both on boundaries and within bands. The operating interval also includes the range in which currency interventions are not made. Revision of the boundaries of the operating interval occurs automatically when the established value is reached by the cumulative volume of BR operations. In order to offset a systematic imbalance between supply and demand for foreign exchange in the domestic market, the volume of targeted interventions is not included in the calculation of that amount. Effective July 24, 2012, the BR widened the band of allowable fluctuation of the ruble from Rub 6 to Rub 7 and reduced the cumulative amount of unplanned interventions triggering an automatic adjustment of the exchange rate band by 5 kopeks from US$500 million to US$450 million. Due to the role of the BR in exchange rate determination, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is also classified as other managed arrangement. The BR intervenes both in interbank currency exchanges and in the OTC interbank market to smooth out daily fluctuations. Since August 2008, the BR has published its volume of interventions both in euros and U.S. dollars by sale and purchase amounts monthly. These data are presented within seven days of the end of the reporting period. Effective May 1, 2012, the BR reports daily foreign exchange interventions data with a two-day lag, with historical data available from January 1, 2011. Previously, since June 2011, the BR published weekly foreign exchange intervention data with a one-week lag."
2012,714,Rwanda,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has intervened directly in order to moderate the rate of exchange and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. In 2012, the franc continued to follow a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band with a slight shift in September 2012. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BNR discloses data on its interventions in the foreign exchange market."
2012,862,Samoa,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) does not publish data on its interventions. Currently, there is no legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement, except the CBS Act of 1984, which states only that the CBS is responsible for setting the exchange rate."
2012,135,San Marino,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. San Marino had a monetary agreement with Italy, on behalf of the EU, that went into effect April 1, 2001, and (1) establishes that euro coins and banknotes are legal tender in San Marino; and (2) gives San Marino the authority to issue a certain number of euro coins, which are legal tender in the euro area and are equivalent in form to euro area coinage. Effective September 1, 2012, a new monetary agreement between San Marino and the EU signed March 27, 2012, went into effect, repealing the previous agreement of November 29, 2000. The new agreement authorizes San Marino to use the euro as its official currency, grant legal tender status to euro banknotes and coins, and issue limited quantities of euro coins (as did the former agreement). Under the new agreement, San Marino commits to adopting the relevant EU legislation (on euro banknotes and coins; combating fraud and counterfeiting; banking and financial legislation, including the prevention of money laundering and statistical reporting requirements) within the time specified by that agreement (1–6 years from the date of entry into effect—(Decree No. 120 of August 7, 2012)."
2012,716,São Tomé and Príncipe,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg against the euro. Beginning February 1, 2009, the focus of the BCSTP switched from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which became the new reference currency for the peg on January 1, 2010. The organic law of the BCSTP authorizes it to make decisions regarding exchange rate policy."
2012,456,Saudi Arabia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rate of the riyal against the U.S. dollar is determined by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) and has been stable since June 1986. The SAMA, in coordination with the minister of finance, decides on changes in the exchange rate arrangement. Historically, the SAMA has not published its intervention data."

2012,942,Serbia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"In accordance with the revised IMF classification system of exchange rate arrangements, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Although the current Decision on the Dinar Exchange Rate Regime stipulates “managed floating” (according to the previous IMF classification system), the main features of the current regime correspond to the description of a “floating” regime based on the IMFʹs new classification system (occasional interventions to moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate without aiming for a specific level of the exchange rate). Since the introduction of this exchange rate regime in 2001 and in accordance with its commitment to liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has tried to reduce its participation in the foreign exchange market and to adjust the features of the existing exchange rate regime—managed floating—in the direction of soft managed floating so as to pave the way for a freely floating exchange rate regime as a prerequisite for the adoption of inflation targeting. This exchange rate regime enables the NBS to balance, when necessary, foreign exchange demand and supply and moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate in either direction (appreciation or depreciation) that may occur under the influence of external or internal shocks to the national economy. The NBS interventions do not aim to achieve a particular level of the exchange rate. In accordance with Inflation Targeting as Monetary Strategy (as of January 1, 2009), interventions are an infrequent secondary instrument used to support the achievement of the inflation target only after the potential for influencing inflation effectively through changing the key policy rate is exhausted. Interventions in the foreign exchange market take place only to moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate of the dinar, in either direction (appreciation or depreciation), in order to contain threats to financial and price stability."
2012,718,Seychelles,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the rupee is determined by demand and supply in the market, with the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) intervening only to smooth exchange rate volatility and manage liquidity. The CBS occasionally participates in the foreign exchange market for reserve accumulation purposes. Operational guidelines specify the role of the CBS as the buyer and seller of last resort in the foreign exchange market. In 2012, the CBS intervened only twice, for a total of US$7.12 million in sales; at times it purchased foreign exchange to build up reserves. The CBS discloses intervention data on its website, which is publicly accessible."
2012,724,Sierra Leone,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating, and the exchange rate of the leone is market determined. The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) publishes its weekly foreign exchange offer amount and the result of the weekly foreign exchange auctions in the print media, on the radio. and on its website. The auction rate is used as a reference rate by market participants but the auction constitutes only about 7% of official foreign exchange transactions. There is no policy targeting a specific exchange rate level. Occasionally, the BSL buys foreign exchange in the market to build up its reserves or sells it through the foreign exchange auction. Effective January 23, 2013, the weekly auction amount was reduced to US$0.70 million from US$1 million. During 2012, the BSL sold US$46 million to supplement the foreign exchange market, compared with US$41.2 million in 2011 and US$48 million in 2010. The leone showed limited volatility against the U.S. dollar in 2012 due to stable market conditions and sufficient foreign exchange liquidity at commercial banks. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2012,576,Singapore,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. The authorities manage the exchange rate as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the objective of maintaining price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. The Singapore dollar is allowed to fluctuate within a targeted policy band and is managed against a basket of currencies of the countryʹs major trading partners and competitors. Currencies in the basket are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the countries in Singaporeʹs trade relations with the world. The exchange rate policy is announced every six months in the Monetary Policy Statement, typically in terms of changes to the slope, central rate, and width of the policy band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. Since April 2010, the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) has maintained the policy of modest and gradual appreciation of the Singapore dollar against a currency composite. After falling to the lower half of the policy band in September and October 2011, the Singapore dollar resumed its previous course and followed an appreciating trend against a basket of currencies within a 2% band since November 2011. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been retroactively reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective November 9, 2011. The MAS intervenes through agents and does not publish information on its interventions."

2012,813,Solomon Islands,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime pegs the Solomon Islands dollar to a basket of currencies, effective October 1, 2012. The previous exchange rate policy of the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) was a peg against the U.S. dollar. The change in policy is based on price stability through greater flexibility to absorb global commodity price movements. However, to prevent large fluctuations in the rate and protect exporters and gross foreign reserves from undue volatility, the CBSI capped exchange rate movement to ±1% around the base rate. The new basket gives the greatest weight to the U.S. dollar, which accounts for 58% of total weight. The Australian dollar is the second largest at 32%. The remaining currencies are the New Zealand dollar at 5%, the yen at 3%, and the pound sterling at 2%. The new Central Bank Act—CBSI Act 2012— was passed by Parliament in November 2012 and went into effect January 1, 2013. Section 16 states that without compromising the primary objective of domestic price stability, (1) the government may, in consultation with the CBSI, determine the exchange rate regime; and (2) the CBSI may, in consultation with the minister of finance, determine and implement the exchange rate policy and enter into foreign exchange arrangements. On April 17, 2013, the CBSI sent a survey to banks, private companies, exporters, importers, and other stakeholders on exchange rate developments and administration in the Solomon Islands since 2000. The survey aims to determine whether the CBSI should consider further revision of the exchange rate administration. After a period of gradual appreciation against the U.S. dollar, the Solomon Islands dollar has stabilized anew against the dollar within a 2% band since January 30, 2012. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified to a conventional peg from other managed arrangement, effective January 30, 2012. Subsequently, in October 2012, the peg against the U.S. dollar was replaced with a peg against a composite."

2012,199,South Africa,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the rand is determined by demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has a publicly announced foreign exchange policy of purchasing foreign currency in the local foreign exchange market from time to time, when market conditions permit, with the aim of accumulating foreign exchange reserves without seeking to influence the level of the exchange rate. The SARB interacts with ADs as the price taker for official and commercial purposes. However, the SARB does not sell foreign exchange to ADs. The market makers and brokers quote prices to other market participants; the SARB does not quote prices for market participants. The SARB does not publish information on its interventions (only monthly releases of the official gold and foreign exchange reserves)."
2012,733,South Sudan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime of South Sudan is a conventional peg, described as a fixed exchange rate regime in the Bank of South Sudan Act (BSS Act). South Sudan introduced its own currency (South Sudanese pound, SSP) on independence in July 2011. The BSS Act specifies that the currency be allowed to float for the first six months to find its market value and thereafter be fixed. In early September 2011, the BSS fixed the exchange rate at SSP 2.95 per U.S. dollar and began rationing foreign exchange. As a result, a parallel market developed in which the exchange rate has been at a premium compared with the official rate. The foreign exchange market is at a nascent stage in South Sudan, and the BSS has plans to implement measures to unify the official and parallel market rates. The de facto exchange rate arrangement classification is currently under review, since South Sudan is a new member."

The CBSL intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the exchange rate. Following a period of stability in the exchange rate, the authorities have limited their interventions in the foreign exchange market and allowed for increased flexibility against the U.S. dollar since February 2012. As a result, the rupee—U.S. dollar exchange rate departed from the stabilized band and moved more freely. Accordingly, effective February 9, 2012, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement. The CBSL publishes intervention data on its website in its annual report."

The exchange rate is determined in the interbank market, in which participants deal directly with each other. The CBOS participates in the market through swaps under a rules-based mechanism that triggers intervention if the exchange rate exceeds a band of ±4% around the previous dayʹs closing rate. The main objective of the policy is exchange rate stability. Effective June 24, 2012, Sudan adopted a new multiple exchange rate regime including (1) a central rate of SDG 4.42 per U.S. dollar that also applies to importation of fuel products, payment of government obligations, and customs valuation; (2) a subsidized rate for wheat of SDG 2.9 per U.S. dollar; (3) a gold exchange rate used by the CBOS in its gold transactions; and (4) an MFR mainly used by the commercial banks and exchange bureaus. The MFR applies to all other transactions and has three components: (1) an indicative rate; (2) a variable incentive premium set by the CBOS (currently 15%); and (3) a flexibility factor that allows banks to deviate from the average of the indicative rate and the incentive by a range of, effective June 24, 2012, ±4% (previously ±3%). Since June 2012, the official exchange rate has been kept fixed at SDG 4.42 per U.S. dollar, while the gap between the MFR and the curb market exchange rate initially dropped from 16.5% on July 31, 2012, to 1.5% by September 30, 2012, only to widen again thereafter to reach 14% by March 31, 2013. Given the focus of the CBOS on exchange rate stability and in line with the fluctuation of the curb market exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. Based on IMF staff estimates, about 60% of total volume of import transactions in 2012 was effected at the curb market exchange rate, compared with 30% at the CBOS rate and approximately 10% at the commercial rate. The CBOS does not disclose information on its interventions to the public."
2012,366,Suriname,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. In accordance with a July 1994 presidential decree (Resolution and Besluit of 1994), the exchange rate is determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange. With the amendment in 2000 (""Wijzigingen Resolutie"") the Central Bank of Suriname (CBvS) was mandated to establish, at its discretion, maxima and minima rates. The exchange rate of the Surinamese dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official market remained stable until January 20, 2011, when the authorities devalued the currency by 20%, to SRD 3.3 per U.S. dollar and set a band of SRD 3.25–3.35 per U.S. dollar, within which all official and commercial market transactions may take place. However, the Surinamese dollar–U.S. dollar exchange rate remained within a narrower band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. In the event of a persistent discrepancy between the official rate and the rates quoted by commercial banks and nonbank institutions, the official exchange rate is adjusted to reflect the prevailing market conditions."
2012,734,Swaziland,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The Central Bank of Swaziland Order of 1974 is the legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement.
2012,144,Sweden,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the krona is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are allowed under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., participation in concerted interventions with other CBs). Sveriges Riksbank (SR) announces its intervention in a press communiqué, explains the motive, and discloses the framework of intervention. However, no intervention has been reported since June 14, 2001."
2012,146,Switzerland,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market. However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free market rates. On September 6, 2011, the SNB set a minimum exchange rate of Sw F 1.20 per euro to stop appreciation of the franc and committed to maintaining the limit by buying unlimited foreign currency. As a result, initially the Swiss franc was classified as other managed arrangement due to its limited volatility based on the role of official action. From January 2012 through mid-January 2013, it remained within a narrower 2% margin of the announced minimum exchange rate. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective January 1, 2012. Following this period of stability, around mid-January 2013, the franc departed from the stabilized band against the euro with limited flexibility, while the authoritiesʹ commitment to defending the minimum exchange rate remained unchanged. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective January 14, 2013. The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual accountability report. In 2012, to combat massive overvaluation and defend the minimum exchange rate, the SNB increased its purchases to approximately Sw F 188 billion in foreign currency (compared with Sw F 17.8 billion in 2011) with a wide range of counterparties in Switzerland and abroad."
2012,463,Syria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Since the revaluation of the pound against the U.S. dollar, the official rate is pegged to the SDR within a ±9% band. Before the political instability in 2011, the pound showed limited volatility against a composite including the SDR basket of currencies (euro, pound sterling, U.S. dollar, Japanese yen), although the U.S. dollar had a larger weight than in the SDR basket. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite. Following the political crisis, a parallel foreign exchange market emerged in early April 2011, diverging from the official rate by about 15%. The exchange rate in the parallel market moved erratically, reaching a high of LS 105 per U.S. dollar in March 2012. During this time, the CBS gradually adjusted the official rate toward convergence with the market rate. On March 10, 2012, the CBS announced that it would trade foreign currency with money dealers at rates other than the official rate published in its daily bulletin. This new price list, called the “intervention list,” is much closer to market prices and has helped ease pressure on the market and bring the market rate closer to the official rate. By December 31, 2012, the official and parallel rates had come under additional pressure, and the two rates diverged by 28%, with the official rate reaching LS 71 per U.S. dollar and the parallel rate widening to LS 91 per U.S. dollar. Given the developments in the official rate, the emergence of the parallel market, and the newly implemented intervention rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2012,923,Tajikistan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, with no predetermined path. The exchange rate of the somoni is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, in which the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) may intervene to limit exchange rate volatility. The NBT provides information on the volume of its purchase and sale transactions in foreign exchange on a daily basis. The somoni has remained stable against the U.S. dollar within a narrow band, except for a short period in 2011 when it gradually adjusted to a new level. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2012,738,Tanzania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bank of Tanzania (BOT) is the major supplier of foreign exchange in a rather shallow market. It has been almost exclusively on the selling side in the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM), in order to sterilize liquidity generated by government spending financed by official inflows. The amount of the BOT foreign exchange sales has varied to avoid disruptive exchange rate fluctuations. The BOT informs market participants monthly of the amount to be sold in the market. Information on BOT intervention is announced to market participants through the Reuters system. Under this system, commercial banks submit two-way quotes (bid and ask) in the IFEM. For parts of 2012, the shilling was relatively stable, showing slightly increased flexibility toward the end of 2012. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2012,578,Thailand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Under the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the value of the baht is allowed to be determined by market forces, reflecting demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. However, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) reserves the right to curb excessive volatility in the value of the baht that is not aligned with economic fundamentals. The BOT does not disclose information on its interventions. Although, the baht experienced a period of stability during 2012, flexibility increased again in the first quarter of 2013. Accordingly, the facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2012,313,The Bahamas,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Bahamian dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at par.
2012,648,The Gambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the dalasi is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Gambia participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the dalasi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15% of the central rate; however, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures. The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange to augment international reserves and ensure market orderliness. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The CBG does not publish intervention data, but all CBG transactions are communicated to market makers."
2012,537,Timor-Leste,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely.
2012,742,Togo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Togo participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc into euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2012,866,Tonga,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. The external value of the paʹanga is determined on the basis of a weighted currency basket comprising the Australian dollar, Japanese yen, New Zealand dollar, and U.S. dollar. The basket weights are determined based on the proportions of trade with trading partners. The weights are not published. The exchange rate of the paʹanga in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) within a band of ±5%. The NRBT does not publish intervention data. Under Section 34 of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (Amendment) Act 2007, the external value of the paʹanga is determined from time to time in a manner approved by the NRBT board, after consultation with the minister of finance, having due regard for the obligations Tonga has assumed in accordance with the provisions of any international monetary agreement to which it is a party or to which it adheres. Section 35(1) of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act empowers the NRBT to set the exchange rate."
2012,369,Trinidad and Tobago,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Given the stability of the Trinidad and Tobago dollar against the U.S. dollar, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) occasionally publishes its intervention data in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report."
2012,744,Tunisia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, as indicated on the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) website. Effective April 18, 2012, a fixing arrangement (i.e., the average of market participantsʹ quotes) replaced the currency composite as the reference exchange rate published by the CBT. Since then, the CBT has intervened in the foreign exchange market through bilateral transactions when market quotes deviated substantially from the daily fixing rate. Previously, the CBT intervened to keep the exchange rate stable vis-à-vis a currency composite using its own rates in response to requests from banks for quotes. The rates quoted by the CBT were based on the currency composite and updated continuously to reflect the exchange rates prevailing in the international foreign exchange markets. During the transition to the new operational framework, since September 2011, the CBT has made several adjustments to the level of the exchange rates in the basket. This resulted in the dinar following a depreciating trend vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar–euro basket within a margin of less than 2%, with a slight reduction in the pace of depreciation since June 2012. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBT posts the volume of transactions between authorized intermediaries (IATs) and the volume of its daily interventions in the interbank foreign exchange market on its website."
2012,186,Turkey,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lira is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) announced the general framework of the monetary and exchange rate policies envisaged for 2013 in a press release titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2013” on December 25, 2012. Given the introduction of the Reserve Option Mechanism (ROM), which allows commercial banks to hold reserve requirements on lira-denominated liabilities in foreign exchange and gold (up to certain limits), the CBRT plans to hold neither preannounced foreign exchange auctions (for sales or purchases) nor direct interventions. However, the CBRT reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market in the event of unsound developments in exchange rates due to speculative behavior stemming from a loss of market depth. In that case the CBRT may either buy or sell foreign exchange at the rates quoted by the banks directly or may intervene through an auction. On June 11, 2013, the CBRT announced that it may hold unsterilized intraday foreign exchange sales auctions or foreign exchange interventions when deemed necessary in order to support short-term additional monetary tightening. Effective June 11, 2013, the CBRT resumed intraday foreign exchange selling auctions with US$50 million to be sold at each auction, and limited the maximum bid amount for each bank to 20% of the total auction amount. Effective June 20, 2013, the amount to be sold at each intraday auction is set individually by the CBRT and posted on Reuters page CBTQ. Effective June 24, 2013, there may be only one intraday foreign exchange selling auction on the days in which funding is provided from the policy rate, and the auction amount is set to be minimum US$150 million and posted on the Reuters page CBTQ at 15:00. Effective July 2, 2013, the minimum amount for the foreign exchange selling auctions was changed from US$150 million to US$50 million, and the maximum bid amount for each bank is limited to 10% (previously, 20%) of the total auction amount. Effective August 1, 2013, the intraday foreign exchange selling auction time was changed to 16:30 from 15:00. Previously, effective January 2, 2013, the CBRT suspended intraday foreign exchange auctions, and effective January 25, 2012, the CBRT had suspended the regular foreign exchange selling auctions, but retained the option to hold intraday foreign exchange selling auctions, with a maximum daily amount of US$500 million. On January 6, 2012, the CBRT started to hold intraday foreign exchange selling auctions as necessary, at each intraday auction: US$50 million was sold and the full amount of offers received was met up to the auction amount. The results of the CBRTʹs daily auctions and volume of its interventions are published on its website. During 2012, the CBRT intervened directly in the foreign exchange market on three occasions by selling US$525 million on January 2, US$326 million on January 3, and US$155 million on January 4, 2012. The CBRT introduced the ROM as a new monetary policy tool. In this framework, the CBRT grants banks the option to hold a fraction of their mandatory reserves for Turkish lira liabilities in foreign currency and gold. The CBRT may increase or decrease the reserve option coefficients (ROC), which is the amount of foreign currency or gold required to meet one unit of Turkish lira required reserve. Typically, the ROC is an increasing function of different tranches of Turkish lira required reserves; the tranches of the mechanism and the corresponding levels of ROC are determined by the CBRT. The ROM has been used as an active policy tool by the CBRT and has contributed to stabilization of capital flow volatility, indirectly influencing exchange rate movement. Given the CBRTʹs policy focus on limiting exchange rate volatility through the ROM, which replaced the role played by auctions and bilateral interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2012,925,Turkmenistan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT) is fully responsible for exchange rate policy.
2012,869,Tuvalu,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Tuvalu is the Australian dollar, which circulates freely."
2012,746,Uganda,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The authorities intervene in Ugandaʹs foreign exchange market when short-term fluctuations jeopardize its orderly operation. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market at the banksʹ quoted rates, using the best bid-ask principle. Since August 2010, the BOU has been conducting daily purchases for reserve buildup purposes, while engaging in targeted sales occasionally as deemed necessary. Effective February 20, 2012, the BOU revised the reserve buildup framework from a fixed daily purchase of US$1.7 million to purchases between US$1 million and US$2 million daily, in response to sharp fluctuation of the shilling during February 2012. Starting in March 2012, the BOU continued its daily purchases of foreign exchange for reserve buildup but varied the amounts to suit the interbank foreign exchange market conditions. The BOU publishes information on its interventions in its monthly, quarterly, and annual reports, including amounts purchased or sold through the reserve buildup program, interventions, and targeted transactions."
2012,926,Ukraine,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Pursuant to the amendments to the Law of Ukraine on the National Bank of Ukraine (NBU), the NBUʹs primary function is to ensure the stability of the national currency, within which the NBUʹs priority is achieving and maintaining price stability. In line with this, the NBU is shifting its efforts toward developing a more robust monetary policy framework focused on domestic price stability with greater exchange rate flexibility. A transition to a free floating exchange rate is planned as the financial system recovers and the transmission mechanisms mature. Meanwhile, the NBU has continued to influence the exchange rate without announcing a specific path or exchange rate target by intervening in the interbank foreign exchange market. During foreign exchange sale interventions, the NBU satisfies all the demand at its quoted rate. The NBU intervenes both in U.S. dollars and in other reserve currencies. Since March 2010, the hryvnia has remained stable against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band with a slight shift of the band in the second half of 2012. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The NBU publishes information about its foreign exchange market interventions on its website."
2012,466,United Arab Emirates,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dirham was pegged to the U.S. dollar in 1980. However, an official decision to do so was made in January 2003. The United Arab Emirates Central Bank (UAECB) does not publish its intervention data."
2012,112,United Kingdom,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the pound sterling is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of England (BOE) has a separate pool of foreign exchange reserves, which it uses at its discretion to intervene in support of its monetary policy objectives. A monthly press release issued by HMT reports HMT and BOE intervention. There were no foreign exchange interventions during 2012."
2012,111,United States,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are not formally ruled out in the United States, but they are rarely used. The secretary of the treasury is responsible for the formulation and implementation of international monetary and financial policy, including foreign exchange market intervention policy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has separate legal authority to engage in foreign exchange operations, which are conducted in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury to ensure consistency with U.S. international monetary and financial policy. The Treasury and the Fed have closely coordinated their foreign exchange operations since early 1962, when the Fed commenced such operations at the request of the Treasury. Operations are conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as fiscal agent of the United States and as the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. Interventions are reported in the Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations quarterly bulletin. U.S. authorities last intervened in the foreign exchange market in March 2011, following the earthquake in Japan, in a coordinated G7 effort to sell Japanese yen."
2012,298,Uruguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the peso is determined on the basis of supply and demand, although the CBU reserves the right to intervene to cushion abrupt changes in a concentrated market of few transactions. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The CBU publishes information on intervention on its website."
2012,927,Uzbekistan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of the supply of and demand for foreign exchange (Article 15 of Law of Republic of Uzbekistan N 556-II on Foreign Exchange Regulation of December 11, 2003). The sum–U.S. dollar exchange rate is used as an operational benchmark, since 95% of the countryʹs trading operations are carried out in U.S. dollars. With the aim of preventing sharp movements in the exchange rate and supporting the exchange rate level that is in line with targeted macroeconomic indicators and monetary policy, the Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) participates in currency trading, acting as a buyer and seller of U.S. dollars and euros. Given that the sum has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2012,846,Vanuatu,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Since 1988, Vanuatu has officially maintained an adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement. Currently, the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a transaction-weighted (trade and tourism receipts) basket of currencies whose weights and composition are not publicly disclosed and are adjusted periodically. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed, because the composite weights are not disclosed and cannot be confirmed, and, in practice, the vatu has been slightly more volatile against a composite than the 2% band typical of stabilized or pegged arrangements."
2012,582,Vietnam,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The official exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange market demand and supply with State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) management in order to implement monetary policy objectives, curb inflation, and ensure economic stability and social security. The dong–U.S. dollar exchange rate may fluctuate around the official exchange rate within a daily transaction band of ±1%. In response, the parallel market rate initially fluctuated before stabilizing around this new level in early 2012. Adjustments to the official rate often follow movements of the interbank rate. Because of the stability of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The SBV does not release its intervention data."
2012,474,Yemen,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been free floating since July 1996. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) receives most of the foreign exchange proceeds of the country, particularly crude oil export revenues, official loans, and official development assistance. The official exchange rate was steady at about Yrl 213.80 per U.S. dollar throughout 2011 and the first half of 2012, after which it hovered around Yrl 214.89 per U.S. dollar during the second half of 2012. The dollar exchange rate in the parallel market was Yrl 228.00 at the end of 2011. It gradually converged with the official exchange rate by mid-2012 and the precrisis situation, when there was only one unified exchange rate in the country. Due to the unification of the official and parallel market rates and stability of the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar since June 2012, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective June 1, 2012."
2012,754,Zambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The official exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) intervenes in the market primarily through transactions with ADs, which are all registered commercial banks. BOZ interventions in the market are published as historical data, and its foreign exchange transactions are published in the fortnightly statistics."
2012,698,Zimbabwe,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The Zimbabwe dollar stopped being used as the domestic currency for economic, financial, and administrative purposes as of February 2009. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender."
2013,512,Afghanistan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market through twice-weekly selling auctions. The results are published on the DAB website. The DAB deals with ADs only through the auction. The primary goal of these auctions is to regulate the growth of reserve money and/or currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction exchange rate volatility. Given the flexibility in the Afghani–U.S. dollar exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2013,914,Albania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lek is based on supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) is not usually active in this market. In accordance with its regulations, intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) Severe and adverse movement in the exchange rate of the lek: cases of excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market are considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementation of Monetary Policy, which seeks to avoid intervening in the market. However, lack of depth in the market and seasonal factors (i.e., seasonal increases in the supply of foreign currency in the summer months and in December and stronger imports during the first part of the year) can result in fast one-way movement, which may disrupt activity in the domestic foreign exchange market. Bid-ask spreads may widen up to 1%, and the interbank market can be under substantial stress. In such circumstances, intervention may be used to restore calm to a disorderly market and to smooth seasonal trends. (2) Considerable exchange rate misalignment with fundamentals: The lek is considered misaligned with fundamentals if there is lengthy overshooting of the exchange rate. (3) In Monetary Policy Document 2012–2014, the authorities adopted a policy of accumulating foreign reserves in the medium term to cover more than four months of imports and the countryʹs short-term external debt. When the BOA intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market, its counterparties are the commercial banks; if necessary, it may carry out its intervention with foreign exchange bureaus. The BOA intervenes through (1) verbal intervention, in the form of press releases in the print or electronic media and/or press conferences; and (2) transactional intervention. The latter can take two forms, direct intervention and intervention via preannounced auctions. In the case of direct intervention, the exchange rate is determined by commercial banksʹ quotes and the BOA Monetary Operations Departmentʹs quotes. When the intervention exchange rate is uniform for all counterparties, the BOA publishes that rate on its Reuters page and simultaneously communicates the rate to commercial banks that do not participate in the Reuters system and to foreign exchange bureaus with which it has contact. When different exchange rates are used, the BOA announces only the fact that it has intervened; it publishes with a three-month lag the amount of the intervention in a quarterly bulletin that summarizes its foreign exchange operations with banks and the public sector. The regulation regarding foreign exchange interventions includes the option to carry out transactional interventions via auctions announced in advance. The BOA announces the date, amount, and currency it wants to buy at least one month before the auction, and the banks submit one bid each (in an amount equal to the limit it has provided the BOA). The BOA decides how much to buy based on the rates offered and its target amount. Following the auction, the BOA publishes the amount offered by commercial banks, the amount accepted by the BOA, the range of offered bids, the range of accepted bids, and the prorate at the maximum accepted bid. The exchange rate was relatively stable in 2013. It was largely determined by macroeconomic factors: a slowdown in economic activity and a deep decline in domestic demand accompanied by a correction in the current account deficit. BOA and MOF interventions in the foreign exchange market in 2013 account for about 1.0% of the total volume traded in this market. Moreover, the MOF published its schedule of interventions for all of 2013 in February. The MOF published its foreign exchange purchasing auctions for 2014 on February 19, 2014, with the first auction to be held April 10, 2014. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2013,612,Algeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Bank of Algeria (BA) does not announce the path of the exchange rate. The external value of the dinar is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the BA is the main seller because of significant inflows related to commodity exports, including hydrocarbons, which, under current law, must be surrendered to the BA. The BA manages the dinar with reference to a basket of currencies, and the rate of the dinar relative to the currencies in the basket is based on balance of payments data. The BA has not set a target range for fluctuation of the dinar outside or within any particular band, and the observed exchange rate movements do not confirm any constant weights of the currency composite. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BA does not disclose information about its interventions."
2013,614,Angola,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. However, the BNA intervenes in the foreign exchange market by holding foreign exchange auctions. The BNA receives taxes in foreign currency paid by oil companies to the government, which it sells exclusively through its auctions. Through these auctions, the BNA influences the exchange rate. Since November 2010, the fluctuation in kwanzas has remained within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with a one-time adjustment in September 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The BNA publishes the auction results and respective reference rates."
2013,311,Antigua and Barbuda,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Antigua and Barbuda participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2013,213,Argentina,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, and the exchange rate of the peso, which is determined in the MULC by supply and demand, applies to all transactions in foreign exchange and foreign currency banknotes. The BCRA intervenes in the foreign exchange market to carry out its reserve accumulation and management policy, which acts as a stabilizer during temporary changes in conditions. The BCRA makes no explicit or implicit commitment with respect to the exchange rate level or path. BCRA participation in the foreign exchange market was 22% in 2013, compared with 9.4% in 2012. In 2013, the peso continued to follow a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% margin. Market supply and demand play a role in determining the exchange rate, as does official action based on the observed path of the rate and intervention in the spot and forward foreign exchange markets. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BCRA publishes its net purchases in a weekly foreign exchange report."
2013,911,Armenia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility, which is defined as short-term, high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by speculative or trend-following elements rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals, which impose significant costs on the economy. Since March 2013, the dram has appreciated within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Thus, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from floating to a crawl-like arrangement, effective March 12, 2013. The CBA intervenes anonymously through the stock exchange, but it may also intervene openly in the interbank market. The CBA publishes weekly intervention data on its website every Monday."
2013,314,Aruba,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg.

2013,193,Australia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"Both the de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as free floating. However, the RBA retains discretionary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market and has done so during periods of significant market disorder and/or gross misalignment of the exchange rate. Given the high level of development of the Australian foreign exchange market, interventions have been rare. The most recent period of intervention was in 2007–08 and was in response to episodes of significant market disorder—that is, instances where market volatility was impaired to such a degree that it was clear that the observed volatility was excessive. The RBA may also vary the way intervention is conducted; it may enter the interbank foreign exchange market directly through the voice or electronic brokerage markets or use an agent bank. As a matter of government policy, wholesale purchases of foreign currency by government agencies are made through the RBA. The RBA manages the flows from purchases on behalf of the government so as to minimize their market impact—for example, by executing these trades when the market is liquid and, if necessary, breaking up the required purchases into a series of smaller transactions. Monthly purchases and sales of foreign exchange are published on the RBA website. Daily data on foreign exchange market interventions are published on the RBA website annually, following the release of the RBA Annual Report."

2013,912,Azerbaijan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. A bilateral peg against the U.S. dollar was adopted in January 2011. The CBA influences the market exchange rate by intervening in the foreign exchange market to maintain the official rate within a prescribed corridor. This corridor is not announced. The CBA publishes its foreign exchange intervention data quarterly. As a result of official action, the manat has remained stable vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as stabilized."

2013,513,Bangladesh,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating since May 31, 2003. The Bangladesh Bank (BB) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to contain undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Following a sharp depreciation of the taka against the U.S. dollar in 2011, the exchange rate was relatively stable from March through November 2012, owing to improved balance of payments conditions and periodic intervention by the BB. Beginning in December 2012, the taka followed an appreciating trend for a short period of three months as a result of increased foreign exchange inflows, and stabilized afterward within a 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from other managed to a stabilized arrangement, effective February 7, 2013. The BB publishes information on its interventions in its periodic publications (e.g., Annual Report)."

2013,638,Benin,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Benin participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the Central Bank of West African States (BCEAO) on September 20, 2005."
2013,514,Bhutan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. No current legal documents establish a fixed exchange rate arrangement; the ngultrum has been pegged at par to the Indian rupee since the introduction of the ngultrum in 1974. Under the Royal Monetary Authority Act of Bhutan 2010 (Provisions 88 and 89), the Bhutanese government, on recommendation of the RMA, may declare the external value of the ngultrum and the RMA will determine the appropriate external value. The RMA does not publish the intervention data."
2013,218,Bolivia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling peg to the U.S. dollar (also called a “sliding” rate officially) and is characterized by small movements that are not announced in advance. The Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) determines the floor price on the daily competitive foreign exchange auction (bolsín) in which the financial system participates. The CBB ensures that the rate is consistent with moderate inflation, thus mitigating external and internal inflation pressure, since the exchange rate is still used as a benchmark for the price of nontradable goods, albeit to a decreasing extent due to dedollarization in real and financial transactions. Within the scope of the official crawling peg exchange rate regime, in an external environment characterized by marked exchange rate volatility and decreasing external inflation, the sliding rate was set at zero to prevent misalignment of the real exchange rate with its long-term trend. Since the boliviano stabilized anew against the U.S. dollar since November 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The authorities consider that the de facto stabilized arrangement does not fully characterize CBB's exchange rate administration as the official policy of crawling peg has not changed. CBB's crawling peg mechanism allows the sliding rate to be set to zero without any regime change if the underlying economic fundamentals warrant it to be so. The CBB publishes data on its exchange market interventions and foreign exchange purchases and sales in the “Weekly Statistics” section of its website."
2013,963,Bosnia and Herzegovina,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The CB covers base money with its foreign reserves, including currency in circulation and commercial bank deposits. The Law on the Central Bank, adopted by the parliamentary assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, guarantees convertibility of the currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are no restrictions on the purchase and sale of foreign exchange. The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) publishes data on its sales and purchases."
2013,616,Botswana,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The official exchange rate of the pula is determined according to a weighted basket of currencies comprising the SDR and the South African rand, constituting a 45% and 55% share of the basket, respectively. The crawl rate is set as the difference between the Bank of Botswanaʹs (BOBʹs) inflation objective and the inflation forecast in major trading partner countries. The crawl rate is thus determined using a forward-looking approach and is revised regularly. In this approach, the authorities periodically determine the crawl rate for the subsequent period, such as the next 6 or 12 months (the annual crawl rate for 2014 is 0.16%)."
2013,223,Brazil,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The exchange rate of the real is determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) intervenes to smooth out excessive volatility.

2013,516,Brunei Darussalam,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD) issues Brunei dollars and manages the Currency Fund. Under the Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA), signed in 1967, which remains in effect between the AMBD and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the monetary authorities agree to the mutual exchange of their currency at par without charge. Government authorities and banks must accept each otherʹs currency at par, and the currencies are customary tender in both countries. Excess currency is repatriated regularly, with the cost borne by the currency-issuing authority. The AMBD must ensure that reserves in the Currency Fund cover at least 100% of the currency in circulation. The AMBD publishes data on the reserves used to cover the currency in circulation in its annual report."
2013,918,Bulgaria,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board, which was introduced by the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) of 1997. The lev was fixed initially to the German mark and subsequently to the euro. The 1997 law was a conceptually new legal act, introducing the currency board mechanism, and cannot be considered an amendment to the previous law of the same name, which was in effect until 1997 and repealed by the new law. Aggregate data for daily euro-lev turnover between the BNB and local banks are published on Reuters page NBOB3. Yearly aggregates are available in the annual report."

2013,618,Burundi,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Burundi franc exchange rate, which was determined mainly by the BRB auction, depreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar in the first half of 2011, while remaining in the stabilized band. Since the BRB reformed the MESD on March 12, 2012, the franc began depreciating more rapidly in 2012. During 2012, the franc depreciated by 14.4%. This depreciation accelerated in early 2013, prompting the BRB to adopt a series of measures to slow the depreciation, against a backdrop of declining foreign exchange reserves. Among these measures (see Section III.H.1.a.3 Auction), a BRB sale of nearly US$9 million on March 1, 2013, reversed the depreciation trend by lowering the reference exchange rate from FBu 1,724.27 per U.S. dollar on March 1, 2013, to FBu 1,569.2 per U.S. dollar on March 4, 2013. Effective April 12, 2013, the BRB replaced the MESD, which had lost symmetry, with the MID. Only the BRB was intervening in the MESD despite the assumption that it was driven by commercial banks, with the BRB intervening only as a last resort. To encourage banks to trade currencies and promote the MID, the BRB acted to prevent exchange bureaus from procuring foreign exchange from commercial banks. The new regulations governing the interbank foreign exchange market allow the BRB to intervene on its own initiative in accordance with market conditions. Because the Burundi franc has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since March 2013, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified from other managed to stabilized arrangement, effective March 6, 2013."
2013,624,Cabo Verde,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The MOFs and CBs of Portugal and Cabo Verde have the authority to change the exchange rate arrangement.
2013,522,Cambodia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. Given the high degree of financial dollarization, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to accommodate demand for riels and maintain exchange rate stability. There were several marginal adjustments in the path of the riel–U.S. dollar exchange rate in 2013. The riel was stable until June, but then increased in volatility. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from stabilized to other managed arrangement, effective July 1, 2013. Detailed intervention data are available on request."
2013,622,Cameroon,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. Cameroon participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CEMAC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB, (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (Joint Monetary Committee) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to amend the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that countryʹs renunciation of the MCA."
2013,156,Canada,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, with the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar determined on the basis of supply and demand. However, in accordance with an intervention policy established by the government in close consultation with the Bank of Canada (BOC), the BOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market on behalf of the federal government to counter disruptive short-term movements in the exchange rate. Intervention is governed by an intervention policy established by the government in close consultation with the BOC. The current policy is to intervene in foreign exchange market on a discretionary, rather than systematic, basis and only in exceptional circumstances. Intervention might be considered if there were signs of a serious near-term market breakdown (e.g., extreme price volatility with buyers or sellers increasingly unwilling to transact), indicating a severe lack of liquidity in the Canadian-dollar market. It might also be considered if extreme currency movements seriously threatened sustainable long-term growth of the Canadian economy, with the goal of helping stabilize the currency and to signal a commitment to back up intervention with further policy action, as necessary. The last time the BOC intervened in the foreign exchange market was as part of the concerted intervention with authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan to counter an excessively strong yen following the March 2011 earthquake in Japan. Earlier, the BOC intervened in September 1998 to influence movements in the Canadian dollar. Interventions are announced on the BOCʹs website, and the amount of intervention is published in the governmentʹs monthly official press release on international reserves."

2013,228,Chile,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate of the peso is freely determined in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Chile (CBC) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market, in exceptional circumstances, to keep the currency near its equilibrium value in order to avoid costly future reversals. These interventions take the form of transparent, well-founded measures, including explicit definitions of the periods and amounts involved and clearly explained reasons for the intervention. The CBC usually announces the amount of foreign exchange it intends to buy or sell in its monthly bulletin. It publishes its auction results daily and its reserves weekly. The CBC did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2013."
2013,924,China,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"China officially maintains a de jure managed floating exchange rate arrangement with a view to keeping the RMB exchange rate stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies to preserve the stability of the Chinese economy and financial markets. Since the PBC announced a more flexible exchange rate regime in June 2010 to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, the exchange rate has varied slightly more than previously. In March 2014, the floating band of the RMBʹs trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market was expanded to 2% (previously 1%)—i.e., on each business day, the trading prices of the RMB against the U.S. dollar in the market may fluctuate within a band of ±2% around the central parity released that day by the China Foreign Exchange Trade System. Since July 14, 2014, the PBC has allowed banks to set exchange rate quotes to their clients based on supply and demand in the market (PBC No. 2014/188). In February 2014 the RMB departed from a 18-month appreciating trend within a 2% margin, and depreciated rapidly while still being managed. While the renminbi appears to have stabilized lately, further observations are necessary to determine the new trend of the exchange rate. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The PBC does not publish its intervention data."
2013,233,Colombia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. All foreign exchange transactions are conducted at a market-determined exchange rate; however, the Bank of the Republic (Banco de la República—BR) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to adjust the level of international reserves, limit excess volatility of the exchange rate, and influence the speed of adjustment of the nominal exchange rate. The BRʹs interventions are based on the guidelines established by its board of directors. The daily and monthly results of the BRʹs intervention in the foreign exchange market and information regarding each auction are available on its website. During 2012, the BR suspended the options auction mechanism and resumed daily foreign exchange purchase auctions on the spot market and continued the purchases throughout the year (for more detailed information on the auctions, see III.H.1.a.3: Auction). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement."
2013,632,Comoros,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The Comoros participates in the franc zone area. The Comorian franc is pegged to the euro at CF 491.96775 per euro; the value of other currencies is determined on the basis of this fixed rate and on the basis of the exchange rates of these currencies in the foreign exchange markets. The exchange rate arrangement is established by (1) the November 23, 1979, monetary cooperation agreement between the Comorian and French governments; (2) the November 23, 1998, decision by the European Council of Ministers authorizing France to maintain its monetary arrangements with the CFA area countries and the Comoros; and (3) the January 14, 1999, order of the Central Bank of Comoros (CBC) governor on euro–Comorian franc parity. Decree No. 87-005/PR, Regulating Financial Relations between the Comoros and Other Countries, and its regulations apply. The government of either the Comoros or France may change the exchange rate arrangement after notification to the other party to the agreement."
2013,238,Costa Rica,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Since October 17, 2006, the de jure exchange rate arrangement has been classified as a crawling band arrangement. In 2013, the Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR) kept its commitment to maintain the band, in order to continue the gradual and orderly transition to a floating exchange rate. The band does not include a central parity. Since January 23, 2009, the crawl rate of the bandʹs upper bound (intervention selling exchange rate) has been C 0.20 per U.S. dollar a business day with the lower bound (intervention purchasing exchange rate) constant at C 500.00 per U.S. dollar. As of December 31, 2013, the intervention selling exchange rate reached C 812.05, indicating a band with a width of 62.4% with the lower bound as the basis. The average exchange rate for the U.S. dollar on the foreign currency market (MONEX) in 2013 stayed in the vicinity of the lower bound of the band, recording an annual average level of C 501.09, C 0.6 lower than the previous year. As a result, the local currency recorded a nominal appreciation of 1.0% (0.4% in 2012). Beginning January 29, 2014, in a national context of reduced foreign currency liquidity, the exchange rate increased rapidly, reaching maximums in the vicinity of C 570 per U.S. dollar in the second week of March. Nonetheless, the rate stabilized as of March 13, 2014, and between that date and April 30, 2014, the exchange rate recorded an average level of C 548.47. The excessive exchange rate volatility prompted the BCCR to intervene within the band, with the aim of preventing sharp fluctuations in the price of the U.S. dollar. Between January 29 and April 30, 2014, the BCCR carried out foreign exchange sales to stabilize the exchange rate for a cumulative sum of US$386.6 million. Effective March 12, 2014, the board of directors of the BCCR broadened its exchange rate intervention policies and approved a form of “interday” intervention in response to significant deviations in the exchange rate relative to the long-term trend in its fundamentals. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from a stabilized arrangement, effective August 30, 2013."

The Croatian National Bank (CNB) may set intervention exchange rates, which it applies in transactions with banks to limit exchange rate volatility. The CNB conducts foreign exchange auctions on a discretionary basis to ensure the stability of the kuna and provide liquidity for payments domestically and abroad (described under Section H.1.a.3. Auction). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. Intervention data (prices and volume) are published on the CNB website."

2013,935,Czech Republic,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The external value of the koruna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) participates. On November 1, 2012, the CNB suspended sales of foreign exchange reserve revenues, which were aimed at preventing a continued rise in the reserve level. In September 2012, the CNB announced additional monetary easing in the context of the inflation-targeting framework, if necessary, in the form of foreign exchange interventions, given that the interest rate was at the zero lower bound. With inflation below target and continued undershooting expected, the CNB announced November 7, 2013, that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market to weaken the koruna to bring its exchange rate against the euro close to CZK 27. The target is asymmetric; the CNB will not intervene to strengthen the currency toward the level of CZK 27. The koruna has traded between CZK 27.0 and CZK 27.7 since then. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from free floating to other managed, effective November 7, 2013."

The BCC, while observing the international reserves target in its monetary program, intervenes to smooth daily fluctuations in the market exchange rate if they exceed 1.0%. The BCC intervenes through an auction, which is the only operational framework for the BCCʹs transactions with the market. The BCC has intervened on both sides of the market. After departure from the stabilized band in November 2011, with increased flexibility for several months, the franc stabilized anew against the U.S. dollar beginning in early January 2012. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2013,128,Denmark,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The formal framework for the Danish fixed exchange rate policy is the ERM II. Denmark participates in the ERM II with a central rate of DKr 746.038 per €100. The central rate is a conversion of the central rate vis-à-vis the deutsche mark before the third stage of the EMU and was last adjusted in January 1987. Denmark has entered into an agreement with the ECB and the euro area member countries on a narrower fluctuation band of ±2.25%. In recent years, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) has consistently maintained a stable krone within less than 1% of the central rate. The DNʹs net purchase or sale of foreign currency during a month is published at 4:00 p.m. on the second working day of the following month in the Foreign Exchange and Liquidity press release. The agreement on Denmarkʹs fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro within a narrow fluctuation band of ±2.25% around the central rate in ERM II was concluded at an informal meeting of the Ecofin Council of September 25–27, 1998, in Vienna, between the ministers for economy and finance and the CB governors of the EU member countries."
2013,611,Djibouti,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"Djiboutiʹs monetary system is based on a currency board. The Djibouti franc has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1949, but the legislation establishing the currency board and determining the fixed exchange rate is Law No. 118/AN/11/6èmeL of January 22, 2011. The Central Bank of Djibouti (BCD) guarantees and provides for unlimited conversion to U.S. dollars of banknotes and coins used as legal tender in Djibouti. The full issuance of Djibouti francs is covered by foreign exchange reserves. The National Assembly of Djibouti has the authority to make decisions regarding changes in the exchange rate arrangement."
2013,321,Dominica,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Dominica participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2013,243,Dominican Republic,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) aims to increase gradually the flexibility of the exchange rate alongside the implementation of the inflation-targeting framework formally adopted in 2012. The CBDR intervenes in the foreign exchange market to avoid instances of excessive exchange rate volatility that might affect the inflation target given that the exchange rate pass-through remains high. Since February 2010, the peso has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%. There was a slight increase in the rate of depreciation from September 2012 through August 2013, while the exchange rate remained in a 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBDR publishes data on foreign exchange sales and purchases in the foreign exchange market by different institutional actors (banks, exchange houses, and remittance houses). The data are published on a gross (all transactions) basis and a net basis (excluding interbank operations). The CBDR does not disclose data on its volume of foreign exchange transactions with banks."
2013,248,Ecuador,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Ecuador is the U.S. dollar, which circulates freely."
2013,469,Egypt,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate is determined through supply and demand in the foreign exchange interbank market, in which the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) buys and sells foreign exchange daily at the prevailing rate. Following a period of stability against the U.S. dollar, the pound, in mid-November 2011, started on a depreciating trend against the dollar within a margin of less than 2% with a one-time adjustment in January 2013. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from a stabilized arrangement, effective November 10, 2011. On December 30, 2012, the CBE introduced a multiple price auction mechanism to buy and sell foreign exchange. The CBE announces the total amount sold, weighted average rate, and cutoff price after each auction. After significant depreciation during the first auction sessions, the pound has been depreciating more rapidly against the dollar. Since July 2013, the pound stabilized within a 2% band against the dollar. This trend continued through April 2014, which led to reclassification of the de facto exchange rate arrangement from crawl like to a stabilized arrangement effective July 3, 2013."

On January 1, 2001, the U.S. dollar became unrestricted legal tender with unlimited redeemability for the settlement of debt in the territory of El Salvador. The U.S. dollar is used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange. The Central Reserve Bank (CRB) must exchange colones in circulation for U.S. dollars at banksʹ request at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per U.S. dollar."

The birr followed a depreciating trend vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar with two one-time devaluations in 2010. Given the pattern of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The NBE publishes the exchange rates and the amount traded in the interbank market."
2013,819,Fiji,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The RBF does not publish intervention data.

2013,915,Georgia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Georgia is floating. The NBG intervenes in the foreign exchange market through foreign exchange auctions, but does not make any explicit or implicit commitment with respect to an exchange rate target or path. Foreign exchange purchase auctions have been directed toward rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, an objective of the authoritiesʹ economic program that is supported by an IMF stand-by arrangement. During January–September 2013, the NBGʹs net interventions amounted to US$555 million. Since October 2013, the lari depreciated by almost 7% against the U.S. dollar. At the end of 2013 and the beginning of 2014, the NBG sold US$440 million in order to curb speculation in the market, but has not intervened since February 2014. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement, effective November 6, 2013. The amount sold at the NBGʹs foreign exchange auctions and the average exchange rates are posted on the NBG website shortly after each auction."

2013,258,Guatemala,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. In accordance with the Monetary Law and the Free Foreign Exchange Convertibility Law, Guatemala has a flexible exchange rate arrangement under which the rate is determined in the foreign exchange market by supply and demand. However, the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene to limit volatility in the nominal exchange rate without affecting its trend. The BOG intervenes through foreign exchange auctions based on a transparent rule that limits daily volatility. Effective January 1, 2014, the fluctuation margin (added to or subtracted from the five-day moving average of the exchange rate) that determines whether the BOG may intervene was increased from 0.65% to 0.70%. The BOG may also intervene whenever the nominal exchange rate shows unusual volatility. From January 1, 2013, through December 31, 2013, the BOG purchased $75.3 million (on eight occasions) and sold $26 million (on four occasions). During this period, the quetzal showed reduced volatility and stayed within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with an appreciating trend between November 16, 2012, and mid-May 2013, and a depreciating trend until October 28, 2013, after which it resumed an appreciating path until the end of the year. Market supply and demand play a role in determining the exchange rate, as does official action based on the observed path of the rate and the high volume of BOG participation in the foreign exchange auctions. Accordingly, effective November 16, 2012, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified from floating to a crawl-like arrangement. Intervention data are available on the BOGʹs website. The change is reflected as of January 1, 2013, corresponding to the first day of the period covered in this yearʹs Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions."
2013,656,Guinea,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Guinea announced its participation in the exchange rate mechanisms (ERM and ERM II) of the WAMZ, which formally limits the fluctuation of the franc to ±15% around a central rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, but this has yet to be implemented. The Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea (CBRG) intervenes once a week through a foreign exchange auction market with active commercial banks. However, a structural excess demand of foreign exchange is not reflected in the exchange rate set during the weekly auctions. Transactions of commercial banks with their customers must remain within a band of ±3% around the last weekly auction rate. As the franc has shown reduced volatility and has remained within a 2 percent band against the U. S. dollar since August 2013, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from other managed arrangement, effective August 26, 2013. The CBRG regularly publishes information regarding foreign exchange market interventions."
2013,654,Guinea-Bissau,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Guinea-Bissau participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2013,336,Guyana,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; the exchange rate of the Guyana dollar is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Guyana (BOG) periodically purchases foreign currency from foreign exchange dealers in order to maintain international reserves at acceptable levels. In accordance with bilateral agreements with the CARICOM CBs, the BOG quotes weekly rates for certain CARICOM currencies. Reflecting the stability of the Guyana dollar against the U.S. dollar as a result of interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2013,263,Haiti,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a crawl-like arrangement since April 2008, except for a disruption in the exchange rate market after the January 2010 earthquake, during which the gourde was classified as other managed arrangement for a short period from January through February 2010. In 2013, the gourde continued on a slightly depreciating path within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange sales and purchases by the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) are used for smoothing exchange rate fluctuations. The BRH publishes information on foreign exchange interventions weekly on its website."
2013,268,Honduras,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling band. The exchange rate of the lempira is determined by foreign exchange auctions of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). Effective July 4, 2013, the BCH maintains an operational band requiring all bid prices for the purchase of foreign exchange to be within a range of 7% above or below the base price, with such prices subject to the requirement that bids in auctions not exceed 1% of the average base price, previously 0.075% of the average reference exchange rate (TCR), derived from auctions during the preceding seven business days (Resolution No. 271-7/2013 of the BCH). The base price is calculated weekly according to a procedure established by the BCH board of directors for this purpose, which includes the following variables: (1) the differential between the domestic inflation rate and the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners, (2) changes in the exchange rates of these countriesʹ currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and (3) the performance of official reserve assets. The external inflation rate is considered to be the weighted average of the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners. Domestic inflation is measured by the consumer price index. The change in the U.S. dollar exchange rates of the main trading partners is measured using the effective exchange rate index, which is compiled weekly on the basis of the weighted average of the exchange rates of the main trading partners expressed in units of their respective currencies to US$1.00. Finally, an adjustment factor is applied to the base price of the auction, depending on the number of months of imports covered by the BCHʹs reserve assets. In July 2011, the BCH (by means of Resolution No. 284-7/2011 of July 21, 2011) reactivated the crawling band system that had been in operation until mid-2005. As a result, following a long period of stability, the lempira was allowed to crawl once again in July 2011 and thereafter followed a steadily depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar, with a small one-time adjustment in November 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BCH publishes its sales of foreign exchange on its website daily."
2013,532,Hong Kong SAR,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires that the monetary base be backed at least 100% by and that changes in it be matched 100% by corresponding changes in the reserve currency (U.S. dollar) at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75–HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—has been in place since May 18, 2005. The monetary base includes issued notes and coins, the balance at the HKMA of banksʹ clearing accounts (i.e., the aggregate balance), and outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Consistent with currency board principles, the HKMA may issue additional Exchange Fund paper when there is an inflow of funds, and the program may expand along with the interest payments on such paper. Issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which back banknotes issued by note-issuing banks (NIBs), must be made against U.S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. Issuance and withdrawal of government-issued notes and coins are settled against U.S. dollars at the same fixed rate. The legal documents that establish the currency board include the Basic Law (Chapter V, Section 1, Articles 110 and 111); the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66); and an exchange of letters between the financial secretary and the Monetary Authority specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system under the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The letters specify that the financial secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system, including the linked exchange rate. Section 3(1) of the ordinance, as amended, specifies that the Exchange Fund “shall be under the control of the Financial Secretary and shall be used primarily for such purposes as the Financial Secretary thinks fit affecting, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong SAR and for other purposes incidental thereto.” The HKMA is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments, and operational means for doing so, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary system. The HKMA makes immediate announcements of the impact on the aggregate balance due to purchases or sales of U.S. dollars by the Currency Board via various information vendors, including Reuters and Bloomberg. The information is also available on the HKMA website."
2013,944,Hungary,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating because of the discretionary interventions made by the MNB in the foreign exchange market. The possible objectives of foreign exchange intervention are listed in the MNBʹs intervention strategy, which has not been published. The strategy aims to avoid disruptive market fluctuations and exchange rate overshooting. However, the strategy emphasizes that the MNB generally refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange market. The MNB converts foreign currency for the government and net current and capital transfers from the EU on the foreign exchange market at foreign exchange market rates. These transactions change the foreign exchange reserve position of the MNB. If the resulting reserve dynamics are not in line with the MNBʹs reserve management objectives, some of the funds are channeled to the market. Transactions are conducted in small amounts at market prices. The MNB announced the policy of channeling the foreign exchange position resulting from EU transfers several times in the past. The latest announcement was in March 2009, for the year 2009. Until 2009, the net amounts were published quarterly in the MNBʹs Quarterly and Annual Reports."
2013,176,Iceland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) may intervene in the interbank foreign exchange market and has done so occasionally. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is floating. Data on the CBIʹs foreign exchange buying and selling are published daily on its website."
2013,534,India,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is largely market determined, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market to manage excessive volatility and maintain orderly conditions without any fixed target or band for the exchange rate. The RBI publishes monthly data on its interventions (foreign exchange purchases and sales) in its monthly bulletin with a one-month lag."
2013,536,Indonesia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating (adopted August 14, 1997). The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Bank Indonesia (BI), however, may intervene—as part of a policy mix—whenever necessary to achieve the inflation target and to maintain macroeconomic stability. When it intervenes, the BI does not target a specific rate or maintain exchange rate movements within a specific band; rather it provides liquidity to maintain market stability. The BI does not disclose data on its interventions. From early 2012 to mid-2013, the rupiah steadily weakened against the U.S. dollar as Indonesiaʹs current account balance shifted into a deficit. However, the BI used a combination of actual and verbal interventions to temper excessive volatility in the exchange rate. Since August 2013, the rupiah has moved more freely. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from a crawl-like arrangement, effective August 19, 2013."
2013,433,Iraq,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) has allowed the exchange rate to appreciate gradually vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar following a predetermined path. Within these limits, the exchange rate of the dinar is determined in the foreign exchange market. Since January 2009, the CBI set the rate of crawl at zero, stabilizing the exchange rate at ID 1,170 per U.S. dollar through January 16, 2012, and, subsequently, at ID 1,166 per U.S. dollar. Effective December 1, 2013, the CBI set the cash exchange rate at ID 1,177 per U.S. dollar, LC exchange rate at ID 1,172 per U.S. dollar, and transfer transaction rate at ID 1,179 per U.S. dollar. Subsequently, effective February 16, 2014, the CBI set the cash exchange rate at ID 1,190 per U.S. dollar, LC rate at ID 1,184 per U.S. dollar, and transfer transaction rate at ID 1,187 per U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement against the U.S. dollar. The intervention data are published on the CBI website."

2013,429,Islamic Republic of Iran,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a managed floating arrangement against a basket of currencies since 2002. The rial was relatively stable in the parallel market between January and June 2013 before starting to appreciate moderately on the back of rising confidence about the economic outlook. The spread between the parallel market and the official rates remained about 20%. Because there was no discernible pattern for the rial under official guidance while the official and parallel market rates diverged, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2013,436,Israel,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the Bank of Israel (BOI) announced in August 2009 that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market in the event of unusual movements in the exchange rate that are inconsistent with underlying economic conditions or when conditions in the foreign exchange market are disorderly. The BOI did not intervene in the foreign exchange market from August 2011 through March 2013. In April 2013, the BOI intervened again in the foreign exchange market in line with the foreign exchange policy announced in August 2009. On May 13, 2013, the BOI announced a multiyear foreign exchange purchase plan to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate. The total amount to be purchased as part of this plan in 2013 was announced to be about $2.1 billion. The BOIʹs assessments of the overall effect on the balance of payments resulting from natural gas production and foreign exchange purchases will be updated from time to time and published. On October 2, 2013, the BOI announced that it will purchase $3.5 billion in 2014 to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate. The BOI purchased $5.3 billion in the foreign exchange market during 2013, of which $2.1 billion was part of the purchase plan to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate and the rest was under the foreign exchange policy announced in August 2009. The BOI does not publish the daily purchases. Since May 2013 the BOI has intervened more than three times in a six-month period, so the new Israeli shekelʹs de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from a free floating exchange rate arrangement, effective May 13, 2013."

The rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market, in which the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) intervenes with sales and purchases of foreign currency to the market. In June 2011, the exchange rate was allowed to adjust gradually while official interventions in the foreign exchange market continued. The exchange rate depreciated at a faster pace in 2012 relative to 2011. As a result, the Jamaican dollar followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2% for 2012. In 2013, depreciation accelerated within a margin of 2% against the U.S. dollar, with two realignments, in November and in December. Given the pattern of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BOJ publishes information on its interventions in its Annual Report and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report."
2013,158,Japan,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the yen is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disorderly conditions in the market. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Interventions fall within the mandate of the MOF, which publishes daily purchases and sales amounts as well as intervention currencies on its website. The Bank of Japan (BOJ), acting as agent of the minister of finance, intervenes in the market through financial institutions and/or brokers. The last time the MOF intervened in the foreign exchange market was from October 31 through November 4, 2011 (¥9,091.6 billion) to address excess volatility and disorderly exchange rate movement. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating."
2013,439,Jordan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dinar is officially pegged to the SDR, but in practice, it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since late 1995. The CBJ is responsible for maintaining the stability of the dinar exchange rate."
2013,916,Kazakhstan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float since February 2011. The main intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Intervention in the foreign exchange market seeks to smooth out demand and supply fluctuations and is prompted by second-tier banksʹ foreign exchange supply and demand. The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) may conduct foreign exchange operations both on the regulated Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) and in the interbank foreign exchange markets. The NBK intervenes on its own behalf directly with market participants based on their quotes and does not publish information on its interventions. Between September 2013 and February 2014, the tenge was managed within an unofficial 2% band against a basket of currencies composed of the U.S. dollar (70%), euro (20%), and Russian ruble (10%). Since February 2014 (following an 18% devaluation against the U.S. dollar), the tenge has stabilized within a (roughly) 1½% band against the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate was reclassified to a stabilized from a crawl-like arrangement, effective February 11, 2014."
2013,664,Kenya,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. Official foreign exchange market interventions aim to moderate the rate of change and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than to establish a particular level. Data on interventions are only partially disclosed. If the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) uses the auction system to intervene, the market is informed of the amount dealt and the average rate. (The average rate is published after the auction closes.) If the CBK chooses to intervene directly (i.e., by buying or selling foreign exchange from or to banks directly through the Reuters Dealing System), the market is informed but amounts and rates are not published. Since 2012, the shilling has experienced relative stability with limited volatility. Given the frequency of interventions in the foreign exchange market, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2013,826,Kiribati,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. There is no central monetary institution, and the authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange. The Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Bank (Kiribati) Limited, the only commercial bank, quotes daily rates for 15 currencies on the basis of their respective rates against the Australian dollar."
2013,542,Korea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the won is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. As such, the system is managed in accordance with the principles defined by the free floating system, and the governmentʹs role is very limited to remain within the range allowed by the free floating system. However, because of the lack of information on the authoritiesʹ interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Korea (BOK) may intervene in the market with the funds of the BOK and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund when it is deemed necessary for the stability of the market. Interventions in the spot market or through derivatives in the forward market are not announced, and intervention data are not published."
2013,967,Kosovo,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The euro is legal tender and circulates freely.
2013,443,Kuwait,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. According to the law of the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK), the exchange rate arrangement is specified by an “amiri” decree in consultation with the governor of the CBK (see CBK Law, Chapter I, Article II). The arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. Intervention data are not disclosed to the public."
2013,917,Kyrgyz Republic,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of the Kyrgyz Republic (NBKR) participates in the interbank foreign exchange market and makes interventions as needed to smooth out exchange rate fluctuations. In 2013, the exchange rate of the som against the U.S. dollar showed an overall tendency to drop within a narrow band, with periods of deviation. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The NBKR publishes information on its website about its daily purchases and sales of foreign exchange."
2013,544,Lao P.D.R.,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. During the first quarter of 2013, the kip appreciated rapidly reaching its lowest point in April at 7,615 kip per U.S. dollar, followed by a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from stabilized to a crawl-like arrangement, effective January 1, 2013."
2013,941,Latvia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Effective January 1, 2014, Latvia participates in a currency union (EMU) with 17 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2013,446,Lebanon,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is free floating. In practice, the exchange rate remains within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Banque du Liban (BDL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market daily from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and from 10:00 a.m. until noon on Friday. The BDL does not publish intervention data."
2013,666,Lesotho,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The loti is pegged to the South African rand at M 1 per rand. The exchange rate is 1:1, backed by a net international reserves position that exceeds 120% of M1."
2013,668,Liberia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to counter speculative movements. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement since November 2011, when the exchange rate departed from the stabilized band, showing increased but limited flexibility while still being managed. The foreign exchange auction data (volume, price, etc.) are published on the CBL website."
2013,672,Libya,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the SDR. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency.
2013,946,Lithuania,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board was established by the Law on Credibility of the Litas and has been in effect since April 1, 1994. The litas exchange rate against the euro was fixed by the Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania approving the proposal of the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) regarding the anchor currency and the litas official exchange rate (February 1, 2002, No. 157) and the Resolution of the Bank of Lithuania on the anchor currency and the official exchange rate of the litas (February 1, 2002, No. 15). Under the Law on Credibility of the Litas, the BOL covers all its liabilities in litai with its foreign reserves. The BOL provides a foreign exchange window for commercial banks and branches of foreign credit institutions (subject to reserve requirements) at their request. The statistics on operations conducted are on the BOL website under “Liquidity Situation in the Banking System.”"
2013,137,Luxembourg,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Luxembourg participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2014, 17 other members (previously 16) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information on its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2013,674,Madagascar,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the official interbank market. The Central Bank of Madagascar (CBM) intervenes in the interbank market to smooth large exchange rate fluctuations and meet foreign reserve targets. Information on CBM daily interventions is not publicly available. Only the weighted average daily rate and the number and amount of transactions are made available to the public through the CBM official site. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating.
2013,676,Malawi,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Official intervention focuses on meeting the net foreign reserves position target and limiting exchange rate volatility and takes into account seasonal fluctuations. In May 2012, the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) devalued the kwacha from MK 168 to MK 250 per U.S. dollar. In anticipation of this devaluation, the RBM took steps aimed at allowing market forces to determine the exchange rate and at improved availability of foreign exchange in the market. Since May 2012, the RBM has not set a target rate and allowed substantial volatility in the exchange rate, including recent depreciation to around MK 435 per U.S. dollar by early January 2014. Official actions continue to play a role in influencing the exchange rate, but the exchange rate movements are largely market determined. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from other managed arrangement, effective May 7, 2012."
2013,548,Malaysia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) operates a de jure managed float for the ringgit with reference to a currency basket. The composition of the basket is not disclosed. As a result of the ringgit tracking a composite, although not closely enough to be classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BNM does not publish its intervention data. The BNM may also transact directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers at the rates it deems fit for the purpose of maintaining orderly market conditions without targeting any particular level of the exchange rate."
2013,556,Maldives,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Since 2011, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. This regime allows the rufiyaa to float within a 20% band around a central parity of Rf 12.85 per U.S. dollar. However, the rufiyaa remained stabilized in a narrow band against the U.S. dollar near the ceiling of the band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Under the Maldives Monetary Authority Act, the president may decide to change the exchange rate arrangement and adjust the exchange rate."
2013,678,Mali,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Mali participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2013,181,Malta,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Malta adopted the euro on January 1, 2008. Malta participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2014, 17 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2013,867,Marshall Islands,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange.
2013,682,Mauritania,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The ouguiya was previously de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar, at an exchange rate of UM 268.6 per U.S. dollar (October 24, 2005, through January 25, 2007). Since 2007, the new foreign exchange market uses a fixing system in which the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) intervenes. The BCM intervenes in order to regulate the exchange market according to its exchange rate policy objectives (smoothing the exchange rate and the projected level of official reserves). Due to the authoritiesʹ role in determining the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. A summary statement of market turnover data is updated daily on the BCM website."
2013,684,Mauritius,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand in the domestic foreign exchange market. Interventions by the BOM in the foreign exchange market are limited to smoothing volatility and do not aim to offset market forces. Because the BOM intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market on both an auction basis and at fixed rates, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Information regarding interventions is published regularly on the BOM website and in its publications."
2013,273,Mexico,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the peso is determined in the foreign exchange market. On November 29, 2011, the Bank of Mexico (BM) announced that starting November 30, it would auction up to US$400 million daily at a minimum price 2% higher (1.02 times Mexican pesos per U.S. dollar) than the weighted average of the previous dayʹs auction sale price in the event of a 2% depreciation from the previous dayʹs price. As of April 30, 2013, this mechanism had been used three times (May 23, May 31, and July 23, 2012), for a total of US$646 million. The auctions were suspended April 8, 2013, because the conditions of national and international financial markets indicated that the volatility of the exchange rate had decreased. Other intervention mechanisms were not considered in the period. Currently, the BM does not operate any intervention mechanism in the foreign exchange market. The BM reserves the right to make extraordinary sales of foreign exchange if necessary due to market conditions. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating, given that there were only three interventions."
2013,868,Micronesia,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Micronesia is the U.S. dollar. The authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange.
2013,921,Moldova,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Moldova (NBM) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the leu against the U.S. dollar. Sharp fluctuations are not specifically defined; however, the NBM intervenes based on market conditions and future expectations of market participants. These interventions do not aim to change the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM intervenes directly at the market-quoted rates and publishes aggregated monthly data on its website regarding its interventions and interbank market turnover. The data show interventions by currency and type of operation (spot or derivative)."
2013,948,Mongolia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The BOM reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market using the U.S. dollar as the principal intervention currency. The BOM intervenes through the auction to limit day-to-day exchange rate volatility in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. The BOM publishes the cutoff rate for each auction on its website.
2013,943,Montenegro,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The euro is legal tender.
2013,686,Morocco,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a composite. Since April 2001, the basket has been composed of the euro and the U.S. dollar, with weights of 80% and 20%, respectively. The Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) publishes its monthly foreign exchange purchases and sales on its website. Authority to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is found in Dahir No. 1-05-38 of November 23, 2005, promulgating Law No. 76-03 establishing the charter of the Bank Al-Maghrib (Chapter II, Missions, Section I, Core missions, Article 8). The exchange arrangement falls within the purview and prerogatives of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The BAM is responsible for its operational implementation (quoted rates, ranges) and any changes and monitors the foreign exchange market."
2013,688,Mozambique,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. As a major conduit for foreign aid flows, the Bank of Mozambique (BM) is the main channel for foreign exchange into the market. It also intervenes to smooth seasonal fluctuations. For its transactions in Mozambiqueʹs interbank foreign exchange market (MCI) the BM uses the quotes shown on the screen for each commercial bank. The BM is therefore a price taker—i.e., it takes the highest foreign exchange selling rate and the lowest buying rate. The BM publishes information on its website regarding foreign exchange transactions in the MCI. It also publishes the schedule of MCI benchmark average exchange rates in the Jornal Notícias and on its website."
2013,518,Myanmar,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. In April 2012, the CBM started daily two-way multiple price foreign currency auctions, which provide a mechanism for the market to determine an exchange rate the CBM can use to set its new reference rate. However, the CBM reserves the right to intervene periodically to mitigate undue exchange rate volatility and support the liquidity of the kyat in the foreign exchange market. The CBM has no predetermined target for the level of the kyat exchange rate or its trading range and expects the value to fluctuate with supply and demand in the market. The CBM has widened the trading band in the wholesale market from ±0.3% to ±0.8% of the CBM reference rate. The kyat has depreciated significantly, trading at about K 977 to the dollar since July 2013. The depreciation is largely a result of higher import demand, seasonality in foreign exchange inflows stemming in part from agriculture, and fluctuations associated with a thin market. In foreign exchange auctions, the CBM has sought to smooth fluctuations, meet demand for foreign exchange, and align the reference with the informal market rate without targeting a specific rate. Due to the multiple exchange rates and divergence of these rates from the official rate, the de facto exchange rate regime is classified as other managed arrangement."
2013,728,Namibia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement is the CMA agreement.
2013,558,Nepal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) is designated as the agency that may decide on changes in the exchange rate system. The NRB publishes its intervention data regularly.
2013,138,Netherlands,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. The Netherlands participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2014, 17 other members (previously 16) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2013,196,New Zealand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may intervene if the exchange rate is exceptionally high or low, if that rate is not justified by economic fundamentals, and if there is a material prospect that the intervention will influence the exchange rate. Interventions may not be used as an attempt to influence the long-term trend of the exchange rate. The net volume of New Zealand dollars sold by the RBNZ increased from November 2012 through December 2013. As outlined in a speech by the RBNZ governor on May 30, 2013, the RBNZ initiated foreign exchange transactions to dampen some of the spikes in the exchange rate in earlier months and is prepared to scale up foreign exchange activities if there are opportunities to have greater influence. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The RBNZ publishes information on its foreign currency assets and liabilities, including its foreign currency intervention capacity (stock of reserves available for intervention) and foreign exchange swap position, on its website but does not publish data on its direct intervention."
2013,278,Nicaragua,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The Central Bank of Nicaragua (CBN) publishes aggregated monthly data pertaining to CBN foreign exchange transactions with the banks and the government.

2013,694,Nigeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The CBN explicitly aims to maintain an exchange rate principally driven by market forces but intervenes to reduce volatility and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. The midpoint of the target exchange rate is 155 naira per U.S. dollar with a soft exchange rate band of ±3%. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The CBN publishes information on its interventions through auction on its website; however, data on interventions in the interbank market are not disseminated. Even though Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires maintaining the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar within ±15% around the central rate, the CBN has not implemented this regime."
2013,142,Norway,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the krone floats freely and independently against other currencies. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Norges Bank (NB) does not normally intervene to influence the exchange rate of the krone; however, it may intervene in the foreign exchange market on short notice if the krone deviates substantially from the level the NB considers reasonable in relation to fundamentals and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target. The NB may also intervene in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level. The NB has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999. Foreign exchange purchases for the Government Pension Fund Global are publicly preannounced on the CB website. In extraordinary circumstances, the NB may provide foreign exchange liquidity via collateralized operations. This was done between September 2008 and July 2009."
2013,449,Oman,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg to the U.S. dollar. According to the Banking Law of 1974, later amended by Royal Decree No. 114/2000, the par value of the rial Omani is determined from time to time by His Majesty the Sultan."
2013,564,Pakistan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) does not explicitly or implicitly commit to an exchange rate target or path. Market intervention has generally been directed toward building foreign exchange reserves and ensuring smooth functioning of the foreign exchange market. The Pakistani rupee started to appreciate rapidly in December 2013, followed by short periods of stability with one-step realignment in March 2014. Due to limited volatility, with periods of divergence, the de facto exchange rate was reclassified from floating to other managed arrangement, effective December 5, 2013. The SBP does not publish information on its intervention."
2013,565,Palau,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Palau is the U.S. dollar, which circulates freely."
2013,283,Panama,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an arrangement with no separate legal tender. The balboa is pegged to the U.S. dollar at par.
2013,853,Papua New Guinea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the kina is determined in the interbank market, in which ADs participate. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to smooth extreme fluctuations; however, it does not publish information on its interventions. From mid-February 2012 through the end of December 2012, the kina remained stable against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified to a stabilized arrangement from floating, effective February 13, 2012. In January 2013, the exchange rate departed from the stabilized band and has since shown increased flexibility. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement, effective January 1, 2013."
2013,288,Paraguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement of the guaraní is floating and the exchange rate is determined by supply and demand. The objective of the Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) under Article 3 of Organic Law No. 489/95 is to preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the CBP aims to smooth seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. Article 47 establishes that the exchange rate is determined by market forces. The CBP publishes information on its foreign exchange interventions in the Informe Económico (Economic Report) posted each month on its website. The CBP intervenes occasionally in the market to smooth the effects of undue fluctuation. The CBP, as the governmentʹs financial agent, receives U.S. dollars from the government flowing from the royalties and compensation paid by the binational hydroelectric entities and exchanges them for guaranís at the request of the government for the purpose of public expenditures. The CBP implemented, effective July 1, 2013, a program of preannounced sales of the U.S. dollars it purchases from the government. The new program is more transparent, better communicated, and more consistent with an inflation-targeting regime. This program indicates in advance the nature, frequency, and size of the CBPʹs foreign exchange transactions to avoid influencing market expectations of the exchange rate. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from other managed arrangement, effective July 1, 2013."
2013,293,Peru,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,Peru has a de jure and de facto floating exchange rate arrangement. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand. The BCRP is authorized by law to intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility without altering the exchange rate trend. BCRP interventions can also be conducted through dollar-indexed bonds and repos. The BCRP publishes daily information about its intervention operations (prices and amounts) on its website.
2013,566,Philippines,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) adheres to a market-determined exchange rate policy with some scope for occasional action solely to prevent potentially disruptive sharp fluctuations. The BSP does not target or support a given level of exchange rate; it allows the value of the peso to be determined by supply and demand. The BSP may participate in the U.S. dollar–peso market directly with market participants or via market makers and does not disclose intervention data, which are for internal use only. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Data on currency swaps settled in foreign currency and nondeliverable forwards settled in domestic currency are reported monthly in Sections II and IV, respectively, of the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which is posted on the BSP website."
2013,964,Poland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the zloty is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, and the zloty is traded freely against all currencies. The Narodowy Bank Polski (National Bank of Poland, NBP), however, may intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary to ensure domestic macroeconomic and financial stability, which is conducive to meeting the inflation target in the medium term. Given that the NBP intervened in the foreign exchange market only once in 2013, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. In addition, the MOF has continued its sale of EU fund-related proceeds in the foreign exchange market since April 2011."
2013,182,Portugal,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Portugal participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2014, 17 other EU members (previously 16) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2013,453,Qatar,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The targeted peg was officially authorized by Amiri Decree No. 34 of 2001 issued in July 2001, replacing the de jure exchange rate policy of pegging to the SDR, which had been in effect since 1975. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) does not publish data on its interventions."
2013,634,Republic of Congo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. The Republic of Congo participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CEMAC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (Joint Monetary Committee) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to amend the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2013,968,Romania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) may intervene to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations. There is no formal definition of excessive exchange rate fluctuations: the assessment is based on domestic and international market circumstances and on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The NBR intervenes either directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers. The NBR does not publish information on its interventions. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement.
2013,922,Russia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement are categorized as other managed arrangement. The Bank of Russia (BR) does not interfere with the development of trends in the dynamics of the rubleʹs exchange rate as a result of fundamental macroeconomic factors and does not fix restrictions on the level of the rubleʹs exchange rate or target values for changes in the exchange rate. However, the BR smoothes sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate through currency interventions (purchases or sales of U.S. dollars and euros in the domestic foreign exchange market) with the aim of gradual adaptation of economic agents to changes in the rate. The ruble value of a dual-currency basket, consisting of the U.S. dollar and the euro, has been the operating benchmark for foreign exchange policy since 2005. Since 2007, the basket has been composed of US$0.55 and €0.45. In 2009, the BR introduced a floating operating interval for the allowable levels of the dual-currency basket, which was set at Rub 7 in 2012. The boundaries of the interval are automatically adjusted by 5 kopeks when the established value is reached by the cumulative volume of currency interventions performed by the BR, excluding the value of targeted interventions. The BR performs currency interventions whose daily volume depends on the position of the dual-currency basket in the operating interval: within the interval, there is a range of Rub 3.10 in which the BR does not intervene; within the adjacent ranges, the volume of intervention increases as the dual-currency basket approaches the boundaries; at the boundaries the BR intervenes with no restrictions on volume (until the value of the dual-currency basket returns to the operating interval or there is a shift in the boundaries of the interval so that the value of the dual-currency basket is within the new boundaries). Since August 2008, the BR has published information on its website about the volume of currency interventions, and since October 2013 it has published the parameters of its operations in the domestic exchange market. The BR decreased the cumulative amount of interventions triggering a shift in the boundaries of the operating interval by 5 kopeks, from US$450 million to US$400 million, effective September 9, 2013; broadened symmetrically the range in which it does not intervene from Rub 1.00 to Rub 3.10, effective October 7, 2013; decreased the daily volume of targeted interventions from US$120 million to US$60 million, effective October 21, 2013; decreased the cumulative amount of interventions triggering a shift in the boundaries of the operating interval by 5 kopeks, from US$400 million to US$350 million, effective December 10, 2013; and decreased the daily volume of targeted interventions from US$60 million to zero, effective January 13, 2014. Given the increasing volatility in the financial market, with the aim of maintaining financial stability, the BR began to set the parameters of exchange rate policy daily. The cumulative amount of interventions triggering a shift in the boundaries of the operating interval by 5 kopeks was increased to US$1.5 billion, effective March 3, 2014. Effective May 22, 2014, the amount of interventions in all sub-bands was reduced by US$100 million, from US$400 million to US$300 million and from US$200 million to US$100 million, with the aim of reverting to greater flexibility. Further, effective June 17, 2014, the cumulative volume of interventions leading to a shift in the floating operational band was reduced from US$1.5 billion to US$1 billion; the US$100 million intervention sub-band was eliminated leading to an increase in the non-intervention zone by 2 rubles; and the amount of interventions in the remaining sub-band was reduced from US$300 million to US$200 million."
2013,714,Rwanda,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has intervened directly in order to moderate the rate of exchange and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. In 2013, the franc continued to follow a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar with several short periods of stability. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from a crawl-like arrangement to other managed arrangement, effective January 1, 2013. The BNR discloses data on its interventions in the foreign exchange market."
2013,862,Samoa,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) does not publish data on its interventions. Currently, there is no legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement, except the CBS Act of 1984, which states only that the CBS is responsible for setting the exchange rate."
2013,135,San Marino,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. On March 27, 2012, San Marino signed a monetary agreement with the EU repealing the previous monetary agreement of November 29, 2000. The agreement authorizes San Marino to use the euro as its official currency, grant legal tender status to euro banknotes and coins, and issue limited quantities of euro coins. San Marino is committed to adopting the relevant EU legislation (on euro banknotes and coins; combating fraud and counterfeiting; banking and financial legislation, including the prevention of money laundering and statistical reporting requirements) within the time specified by that agreement (one to six years from the effective date—Decree No. 120 of August 7, 2012). During 2013, production rules were oriented mainly toward full transposition of EU legislation in the implementation of the obligations arising from participation in the monetary agreement."
2013,716,São Tomé and Príncipe,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg against the euro. Beginning February 1, 2009, the focus of the Central Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) switched from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which became the new reference currency for the peg on January 1, 2010. The organic law of the BCSTP authorizes it to make decisions regarding exchange rate policy."
2013,456,Saudi Arabia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rate of the riyal against the U.S. dollar is determined by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) and has been stable since June 1986. The SAMA, in coordination with the minister of finance, decides on changes in the exchange rate arrangement. Historically, the SAMA has not published its intervention data."
2013,722,Senegal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Senegal participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2013,942,Serbia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"In accordance with the revised IMF classification system of exchange rate arrangements, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The current Decision on the Dinar Exchange Rate Regime stipulates “managed floating.” Since the introduction of this exchange rate regime in 2001 and in accordance with its commitment to liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has tried to reduce its participation in the foreign exchange market and to adjust the features of the existing exchange rate regime—managed floating—in the direction of soft managed floating so as to pave the way for a freely floating exchange rate regime in the future. This exchange rate regime enables the NBS to balance, when necessary, foreign exchange demand and supply and moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate in either direction (appreciation or depreciation) that may occur under the influence of external or internal shocks to the national economy. The NBS interventions do not aim to achieve a particular level of the exchange rate. In accordance with Inflation Targeting as Monetary Strategy (as of January 1, 2009), interventions are an infrequent secondary instrument used to support the achievement of the inflation target only after the potential for influencing inflation effectively through changing the key policy rate is exhausted. Interventions in the foreign exchange market take place only to moderate excessive daily short-term volatility of the exchange rate of the dinar, in either direction (appreciation or depreciation), in order to contain threats to financial and price stability and safeguard an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves."
2013,718,Seychelles,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the rupee is determined by demand and supply in the market, with the Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) intervening only to smooth exchange rate volatility and manage liquidity. The CBS occasionally participates in the foreign exchange market for reserve accumulation. Operational guidelines designate the CBS as the buyer and seller of last resort in the foreign exchange market. Since mid-March 2013, the rupee depreciated within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar with one trend adjustment in July, 2013. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from floating to a crawl-like arrangement, effective March 12, 2013. Given that the rupee increased its volatility and departed from the 2% band against the U.S. dollar in April 2014, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from a crawl-like to a floating arrangement, effective March 27, 2014. The CBS discloses intervention data on its website, which is publicly accessible."
2013,724,Sierra Leone,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating, and the exchange rate of the leone is market determined. The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) does not target a specific level of the exchange rate. Occasionally, it buys or sells foreign exchange in the market to build up its reserves and sells to the market through the foreign exchange auction. The BSL publishes the amount of foreign exchange it offers weekly for auction and the result of the weekly foreign exchange auction in the print media, on the radio, and on its website. The weekly auction amount was reduced from US$1 million to US$0.70 million, effective January 23, 2013; and to US$0.50 million, effective July 10, 2013. The leone showed limited volatility against the U.S. dollar in 2013 due to increased foreign exchange inflows from the mining sector. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2013,576,Singapore,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. The authorities manage the exchange rate as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the objective of maintaining price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. The Singapore dollar is allowed to fluctuate within a targeted policy band and is managed against a basket of currencies of the countryʹs major trading partners and competitors. Currencies in the basket are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the countries in Singaporeʹs trade relations with the world. The exchange rate policy is announced every six months in the Monetary Policy Statement, typically in terms of changes to the slope, central rate, and width of the policy band. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. In 2013, the Singapore dollar remained stable within a 2% band against a currency composite. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from a crawl-like arrangement to stabilized, effective January 1, 2013. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) intervenes through agents and does not publish information on its interventions."

When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2013,813,Solomon Islands,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime pegs the Solomon Islands dollar (SBD) to a basket of currencies. The policy aims to ensure price stability and maintain a managed exchange rate policy in line with economic fundamentals and offer some flexibility. The SBD was expected to fluctuate on daily basis but within a managed ±1% band around the base rate. In 2013, the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) maintained a basket of currencies that gave the greatest weight to the U.S. dollar (USD), which accounted for 58% of total weight. The Australian dollar was the second largest at 32%. The remaining currencies were the New Zealand dollar at 5%, the yen at 3%, and the pound sterling at 2%. The new Central Bank Act—CBSI Act 2012—went into effect January 1, 2013. Section 16 states that without compromising the primary objective of domestic price stability, (1) the government may, after consultation with the CBSI, determine the exchange rate regime; and (2) the CBSI may, after consultation with the minister of finance, determine and implement the exchange rate policy and enter into foreign exchange arrangements. On April 17, 2013, the CBSI conducted a survey on exchange rate developments and administration in the Solomon Islands since 2000. It sent an exchange rate questionnaire to banks, private companies, exporters, importers, and other stakeholders. The objective of the survey was to determine whether the CBSI should consider further revision of the exchange rate administration. After a period of gradual appreciation against the USD, the SBD has stabilized anew against the dollar within a 2% band since January 30, 2012. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified to a conventional peg from other managed arrangement, effective January 30, 2012. Subsequently, in October 2012, the peg against the USD was replaced with a peg against a composite. Given the continued accumulation of international reserves, which provide sufficient policy space to adjust the nominal exchange rate, the CBSI reviewed the exchange rate regime to further align the policy with economic fundamentals while maintaining the policy and the currency weight. Effective June 26, 2013, as a result of the survey, the CBSI made a downward adjustment to the base rate from SI$7.35 to SI$7.28 per USD while maintaining the ±1% band around the new base rate. However, an evaluation of the recent change found that the SBD is not moving with the movement of the basket, which aimed to mitigate some of the movement in the USD, and the SBD seemed to be moving with the USD rather than with the basket peg arrangement leading to wide appreciation and overvaluation of the SBD. In October 2013, the regime was assessed by the IMF Article IV mission, which noted that the SBD was moderately overvalued and recommended that the CBSI avoid further nominal appreciation. Following technical discussions with the IMF and the staff of the CBSI on the basket peg arrangement, there was a consensus to modify the formula that determines the bilateral exchange rate against the USD. In May 2014, the CBSI revised the exchange rate management policy that modifies the exchange rate formula applied for the implementation of the exchange rate policy that pegs the SBD to an invoice-weighted basket of currencies. The aim was to (1) ensure that daily management of the exchange rate follows the basket peg more closely to achieve a constant and stable exchange rate; (2) ensure that the currency peg does not lead to real exchange rate misalignment (overvaluation, etc.) in the presence of inflation differentials with Solomon Islandsʹ trading partners; and (3) review the merits of widening the current band of ±1% to ±1.5% around the base parity of the bilateral (SBD/USD) exchange rate in order to benefit more fully from the advantages of a basket peg. Effective May 27, 2014, the SBD per USD value is the value of the index times the SBD per USD value on the day the basket peg was introduced. The exchange rate (midrate) is now expressed in SBD per USD and is determined by the total index of the basket multiplied by the initial base rate expressed in SBD rather than in USD as was done previously."
2013,726,Somalia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,No recent information on the exchange rate arrangement is available.
2013,199,South Africa,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the rand is determined by demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has a publicly announced foreign exchange policy of purchasing foreign currency in the local foreign exchange market from time to time, when market conditions permit, with the aim of accumulating foreign exchange reserves without seeking to influence the exchange rate. The SARB interacts with ADs as the price taker for official and commercial purposes. The market makers and brokers quote prices to other market participants; the SARB does not quote prices for market participants. The SARB does not publish information on its interventions (only monthly releases of the official gold and foreign exchange reserves)."
2013,733,South Sudan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime of South Sudan is a conventional peg, described as a fixed exchange rate regime in the Bank of South Sudan Act (BSS Act). South Sudan introduced its currency (South Sudanese pound, SSP) on independence in July 2011. The BSS Act specifies that the currency be allowed to float for the first six months to find its market value and thereafter be fixed. In early September 2011, the BSS fixed the exchange rate at SSP 2.95 per U.S. dollar and began rationing foreign exchange. As a result, a parallel market developed in which the exchange rate is at a premium compared with the official rate. The foreign exchange market is at a nascent stage, and the BSS plans to implement measures to unify the official and parallel market rates."

The CBSL intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the exchange rate. Since October 2013, the Sri Lanka rupee has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a stabilized from a floating arrangement, effective October 1, 2013. The CBSL publishes intervention data on its website in its annual report."
2013,361,St. Kitts and Nevis,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Kitts and Nevis participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."

2013,732,Sudan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating. The exchange rate is determined in the interbank market, in which participants deal directly with each other. The CBOS participates in the market through swaps under a rules-based mechanism that triggers intervention if the exchange rate exceeds a band of ±4% around the previous dayʹs closing rate. The main objective of the policy is exchange rate stability. Effective September 24, 2013, the CBOS modified Sudanʹs multiple exchange rate regime adopted June 24, 2012, to include (1) a central rate of SDG 5.68 per U.S. dollar (previously SDG 4.42) that also applies to fuel imports, payment of government obligations, and customs valuation; (2) a gold exchange rate used by the CBOS for gold transactions; and (3) an MFR used mainly by commercial banks and exchange bureaus. An SDG 2.9 per U.S. dollar subsidized rate for wheat of was eliminated, effective September 23, 2013. The MFR applies to all other transactions and has two components: (1) an indicative rate; and (2) a flexibility factor that allows banks to deviate from the average of the indicative rate and the incentive by a range of ±4%; a variable incentive premium set by the CBOS of 15% was eliminated, effective September 24, 2013. The rate for collecting the customs revenues is now altered on a daily basis. Since June 2012, the official exchange rate has been kept fixed at SDG 4.42 per U.S. dollar, but depreciated suddenly to 5.68 per U.S. dollar with a one-time realignment on September 24, 2013. Given the focus of the CBOS on exchange rate stability and in line with the fluctuation of the curb market exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The CBOS does not disclose information on its interventions to the public."
2013,366,Suriname,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. In accordance with a July 1994 presidential decree, the exchange rate is determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange. The exchange rate of the Surinamese dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official market remained stable until January 20, 2011, when the authorities devalued the currency by 20%, to SRD 3.3 per U.S. dollar, and set a band of SRD 3.25–3.35 per U.S. dollar, within which all official and commercial market transactions may take place. However, the Surinamese dollar–U.S. dollar exchange rate remained within a narrower band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. In the event of a persistent discrepancy between the official rate and the rates quoted by commercial banks and nonbank institutions, the official exchange rate is adjusted to reflect the prevailing market conditions."
2013,734,Swaziland,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The Central Bank of Swaziland Order of 1974 is the legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement.

The exchange rate of the krona is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are allowed under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., participation in concerted interventions with other CBs). Sveriges Riksbank (SR) announces its intervention in a press communiqué, explains the motive, and discloses the framework of intervention. However, no intervention has been reported since June 14, 2001."
2013,146,Switzerland,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market. However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free market rates. On September 6, 2011, the SNB set a minimum exchange rate of Sw F 1.20 per euro to contain deflationary risks and stop a sharp appreciation of the franc and committed to maintaining the limit by buying unlimited foreign currency. As a result, initially the Swiss franc was classified as other managed arrangement due to its limited volatility based on the role of official action. In 2013, the SNB commitment to defending the minimum exchange rate remained unchanged. After a short period of volatility, the Swiss franc has followed an appreciating trend within a 2% band against the euro since May 31, 2013. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate was reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from other managed, effective May 29, 2013. The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual accountability report."
2013,463,Syria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Before the political instability in 2011, the pound showed limited volatility against a composite including the SDR basket of currencies (euro, pound sterling, U.S. dollar, Japanese yen), although the U.S. dollar had a larger weight than in the SDR basket. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite. Following the political crisis, a parallel foreign exchange market emerged in early April 2011, diverging from the official rate by about 15%. The exchange rate in the parallel market moved erratically, reaching a high of LS 105 per U.S. dollar in March 2012. During this time, the CBS gradually adjusted the official rate toward convergence with the market rate. On March 10, 2012, the CBS announced that it would trade foreign currency with money dealers at rates other than the official rate published in its daily bulletin. This new price list, called the “intervention list,” is much closer to market prices and has helped ease pressure on the market and bring the market rate closer to the official rate. By December 31, 2012, the official and parallel rates had come under additional pressure, and the two rates diverged by 28%, with the official rate reaching LS 71 per U.S. dollar and the parallel rate widening to LS 91 per U.S. dollar. As of November 11, 2013 (date of latest available data on the parallel foreign exchange rate), both the official and parallel exchange rates increased substantially: the parallel foreign exchange rate reached LS 145 per U.S. dollar while the official rate stood at LS 140, narrowing the divergence between the two rates to 3.6%. Given the developments in the official rate, the emergence of the parallel market, and the intervention rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2013,923,Tajikistan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, with no predetermined path. The exchange rate of the somoni is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, in which the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) may intervene to limit exchange rate volatility. The NBT provides information on the volume of its purchase and sale transactions in foreign exchange on a daily basis. The somoni has remained stable against the U.S. dollar within a narrow band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2013,738,Tanzania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. In recent years, the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) has participated in the interbank foreign exchange market mostly on the selling side. The policy intention of selling U.S. dollars has been to sterilize liquidity generated by government spending of aid funds. BOT foreign exchange sales have varied depending on the liquidity in the economy and the amount and effectiveness of other monetary policy instruments. The BOT informs the market of the target sale of foreign exchange in a month. Trading in the interbank foreign exchange market is conducted using the Reuters trading platform in a two-way quote system. The BOT is not required to indicate two-way quotes when it participates in the interbank market. In 2013, the shilling–U.S. dollar rate depreciated steadily until July, after which it began to appreciate—somewhat faster in the first two weeks of December. The last two weeks of December were marked by a depreciating trend. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2013,578,Thailand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. Under the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the value of the baht is allowed to be determined by market forces, reflecting demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. However, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) reserves the right to curb excessive volatility in the value of the baht that is not aligned with economic fundamentals."
2013,313,The Bahamas,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Bahamian dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at par.
2013,648,The Gambia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Gambia participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the dalasi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15% of the central rate; however, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures. The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange to augment international reserves and ensure market orderliness. Following a sharp depreciation of the dalasi against the U.S. dollar in 2012, the exchange rate was relatively stable during 2013 with some spikes and sharp realignments mostly due to presidential exchange rate directives that imposed overvalued exchange rates, issued in October 2012, June 2013, July 2013, and August 2013. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from floating to other managed, effective January 1, 2013. The CBG does not publish intervention data."
2013,537,Timor-Leste,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely.
2013,742,Togo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Togo participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2013,866,Tonga,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. The external value of the paʹanga is determined on the basis of a weighted currency basket comprising the Australian dollar, Japanese yen, New Zealand dollar, and U.S. dollar. The basket weights are determined based on the proportions of trade with trading partners. The weights are not published. The exchange rate of the paʹanga in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) within a band of ±5%. The NRBT does not publish intervention data. Under Section 34 of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (Amendment) Act 2007, the external value of the paʹanga is determined from time to time in a manner approved by the NRBT board, after consultation with the minister of finance, having due regard for the obligations Tonga has assumed in accordance with the provisions of any international monetary agreement to which it is a party or to which it adheres. Section 35(1) of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act empowers the NRBT to set the exchange rate."
2013,369,Trinidad and Tobago,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Given the stability of the Trinidad and Tobago dollar against the U.S. dollar, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) occasionally publishes its intervention data in the semiannual Monetary Policy Report."
2013,744,Tunisia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, as indicated on the Central Bank of Tunisia (CBT) website. Effective April 18, 2012, a fixing arrangement (i.e., the average of market participantsʹ quotes) replaced the currency composite as the reference exchange rate published by the CBT. Since then, the CBT has intervened in the foreign exchange market through bilateral transactions when market quotes deviated substantially from the daily fixing rate, with a view to smoothing excessive fluctuations of the dinar exchange rate. Previously, the CBT intervened to keep the exchange rate stable vis-à-vis a currency composite using its own rates in response to requests from banks for quotes. The rates quoted by the CBT were based on the currency composite and updated continuously to reflect the exchange rates prevailing in the international foreign exchange markets. During the transition to the new operational framework, since September 2011, the CBT has made several adjustments to the level of the exchange rates in the basket. This resulted in the dinar following a depreciating trend vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar–euro basket within a margin of less than 2%, with a slight reduction in the pace of depreciation since January 2014. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBT posts the volume of transactions between authorized intermediaries (IATs) and the volume of its daily interventions in the interbank foreign exchange market on its website."
2013,186,Turkey,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lira is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) announced the general framework of the monetary and exchange rate policies envisaged for 2014 in a presentation titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2014” on December 24, 2013. The CBRT may intervene directly or through flexible auctions in the market in both directions, in case of unhealthy price formation due to speculative behavior stemming from a loss of market depth. In that case, the CBRT may buy or sell foreign exchange at the rates quoted by the banks directly. Effective January 2, 2013, the CBRT suspended the intraday foreign exchange selling auctions. On June 11, 2013, the CBRT announced that it may hold unsterilized intraday foreign exchange sales auctions or foreign exchange interventions when deemed necessary in order to support short-term additional monetary tightening. Effective June 11, 2013, the CBRT resumed intraday foreign exchange selling auctions with US$50 million to be sold at each auction and limited the maximum bid for each bank to 20% of the total auction amount. Effective June 20, 2013, the amount to be sold at each intraday auction is set individually by the CBRT and posted on Reuters page CBTQ. Effective June 24, 2013, there may be only one intraday foreign exchange selling auction on days in which funding is provided from the policy rate, and the auction amount is set to be at least US$150 million and posted on Reuters page CBTQ at 3:00 p.m. Effective July 2, 2013, the minimum amount for the foreign exchange selling auctions was changed from US$150 million to US$50 million, and the maximum bid amount for each bank was limited to 10% (previously 20%) of the total auction amount. Effective July 24, 2013, foreign exchange selling auctions were suspended on additional monetary tightening days. Effective August 1, 2013, the intraday foreign exchange selling auction time was changed to 4:30 p.m. from 3:00 p.m. Effective August 21, 2013, the minimum amount for the foreign exchange selling auctions was changed from US$50 million to US$100 million. Effective August 22, 2013, the daily minimum sale amount for the foreign exchange selling auctions is announced at 10:30 a.m. Effective September 20, 2013, the intraday foreign exchange selling auction amount was changed to at least US$20 million. Effective December 11, 2013, the intraday foreign exchange selling auction amount was changed from US$20 million to at least US$50 million. Effective December 20, 2013, the CBRT announced that on days when excessive volatility in the exchange rates is observed, the foreign currency sales amount may be raised up to 10 times the announced minimum amount. Effective December 24, 2013, the CBRT announced that the planned minimum foreign exchange selling auction amount was US$450 million every day for the rest of December 2013 and US$100 million every day in January 2014. The results of the CBRTʹs daily auctions and volume of its interventions are published on its website. Between June 11 and December 31, 2013, the CBRT intervened in the foreign exchange market through regular auctions in a total amount of US$17.6 billion. The CBRT introduced the reserve option mechanism (ROM) as a new monetary policy tool. In this framework, the CBRT allows banks to hold a fraction of their mandatory reserves for lira liabilities in foreign currency and gold. The CBRT may increase or decrease the reserve option coefficients (ROCs), the amount of foreign currency or gold required to meet one unit of Turkish lira required reserve. Typically, the ROC is an increasing function of different tranches of lira required reserves; the tranches of the mechanism and the corresponding levels of ROC are determined by the CBRT. The ROM has been used as an active policy tool by the CBRT and has contributed to stabilization of capital flow volatility, indirectly influencing exchange rate movement. Given the CBRTʹs policy focus on limiting exchange rate volatility through the ROM, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2013,925,Turkmenistan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT) is responsible for exchange rate policy implementation. The Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan (CMT) takes ultimate responsibility for economic policy decisions.
2013,869,Tuvalu,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Tuvalu is the Australian dollar, which circulates freely."
2013,746,Uganda,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The authorities intervene in Ugandaʹs foreign exchange market when short-term fluctuations jeopardize its orderly operation. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market at the banksʹ quoted rates using the best bid-ask principle. Since August 2010, the BOU has conducted daily purchases to build reserves while engaging in targeted sales as necessary. The BOU publishes information on its interventions in its monthly, quarterly, and annual reports, including amounts purchased and sold through the reserve buildup program, interventions, and targeted transactions."
2013,926,Ukraine,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Between March 2010 and December 31, 2013, the hryvnia remained stable against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band, with a slight shift of the band in the second half of 2012. In January 2014, the market exchange rate began depreciating, despite NBU interventions. In February 2014, the NBU discontinued massive interventions in support of the hryvnia. Effective February 7, 2014, the NBU adjusted its official hryvnia–U.S. dollar exchange rate broadly in line with the market exchange rate and resumed the practice of setting the official exchange rate based on the weighted average rate for the foreign exchange transactions of the previous day. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from a stabilized arrangement. Effective April 4, 2014, the NBU sets its official exchange rate based on the weighted average rate for the foreign exchange transactions of the same day. The NBU publishes monthly information about its foreign exchange market interventions on its website."
2013,466,United Arab Emirates,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The dirham was pegged to the U.S. dollar in 1980. A January 2003 decision made the peg official. The United Arab Emirates Central Bank (UAECB) does not publish its intervention data.
2013,112,United Kingdom,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the pound sterling is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of England (BOE) has a separate pool of foreign exchange reserves, which it uses at its discretion to intervene in support of its monetary policy objectives. A monthly press release issued by Her Majestyʹs Treasury (HMT) reports HMT and BOE intervention. There were no foreign exchange interventions during 2013."
2013,111,United States,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are not formally ruled out in the United States, but they are rarely used. The secretary of the treasury is responsible for the formulation and implementation of international monetary and financial policy, including foreign exchange market intervention policy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has separate legal authority to engage in foreign exchange operations, which are conducted in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury to ensure consistency with U.S. international monetary and financial policy. The Treasury and the Fed have closely coordinated their foreign exchange operations since early 1962, when the Fed commenced such operations at the request of the Treasury. Operations are conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as fiscal agent of the United States and as the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. Interventions are announced when they occur and the size of the interventions is reported in the Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations quarterly bulletin. U.S. authorities last intervened in the foreign exchange market in March 2011, following the earthquake in Japan, in a coordinated G7 effort to sell Japanese yen."
2013,298,Uruguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the peso is determined on the basis of supply and demand, although the CBU reserves the right to intervene to cushion abrupt changes in a concentrated market of few transactions. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The CBU publishes information on intervention on its website."
2013,927,Uzbekistan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of the supply of and demand for foreign exchange (Article 15 of Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 556-II on Foreign Exchange Regulation of December 11, 2003). The sum–U.S. dollar exchange rate is used as an operational benchmark, since 95% of the countryʹs trading operations are carried out in U.S. dollars. With the aim of preventing sharp movements in the exchange rate and supporting the exchange rate level that is in line with targeted macroeconomic indicators and monetary policy, the CBU participates in currency trading, acting as a buyer and seller of U.S. dollars and euros. Given that the sum has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2013,846,Vanuatu,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Since 1988, Vanuatu has officially maintained an adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement. Currently, the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a transaction-weighted (trade and tourism receipts) basket of currencies whose weights and composition are not publicly disclosed and are adjusted periodically. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed, because the composite weights are not disclosed and cannot be confirmed, and, in practice, the vatu has been slightly more volatile against a composite than the 2% band typical of stabilized or pegged arrangements."
2013,299,Venezuela,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a dual exchange rate system, with the official exchange rate (CADIVI) pegged to the U.S. dollar at the unified exchange rate of Bs 6.30 per U.S. dollar, while the supplementary foreign exchange system SICAD has a rate fluctuating at each auction."
2013,582,Vietnam,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The official exchange rate is determined on the basis of foreign exchange market demand and supply with State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) management based on a currency basket of countries with trade, financing, and investment relationships with Vietnam in order to implement monetary policy objectives, curb inflation, and ensure economic stability and social security. The dong–U.S. dollar exchange rate may fluctuate around the official exchange rate within a daily transaction band of ±1%. Adjustments to the official rate often follow movements of the interbank rate. Because of the stability of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The SBV does not release its intervention data."
2013,474,Yemen,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been free floating since July 1996. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) receives most of the foreign exchange proceeds of the country, particularly crude oil export revenues, official loans, and official development assistance. The official exchange rate was steady at about Yrls 213.80 per U.S. dollar throughout 2011 and the first half of 2012, after which it hovered around Yrls 214.89 per U.S. dollar during the second half of 2012. The dollar exchange rate in the parallel market was Yrls 228.00 at the end of 2011. It gradually converged with the official exchange rate by mid-2012 which led to the unification of the exchange rates. Due to the unification of the official and parallel market rates and stability of the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar since June 2012, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2013,754,Zambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The official exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The BOZ intervenes primarily through transactions with ADs, which are all registered commercial banks. BOZ interventions are published as historical data, and its foreign exchange transactions are published in the biweekly statistics."
2013,698,Zimbabwe,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The Zimbabwe dollar is no longer used as the domestic currency for economic, financial, and administrative purposes as of February 2009. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender."
2014,512,Afghanistan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market through twice-weekly selling auctions. The results are published on the DAB website. The DAB deals with ADs only through the auction. The primary goal of these auctions is to regulate the growth of reserve money and/or currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction exchange rate volatility. While the Afghani appears to have reduced its volatility and stabilized since December 2014, further observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as floating."
2014,914,Albania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lek is based on supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) is not usually active in this market. In accordance with its regulations, intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) calming a disorderly market, which arises due to seasonality and lack of market depth. Interbank market bid-ask spreads, total market turnover, and speed of one-way moves are taken into consideration when intervening to calm a disorderly market. Excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market is considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementation of Monetary Policy, which seeks to avoid intervening in the market. Foreign exchange market liquidity has improved over time, and the last time the BOA intervened to calm a disorderly market was in the first half of 2009; (2) considerable exchange rate misalignment with fundamentals: The lek is considered misaligned with fundamentals if there is lengthy overshooting of the exchange rate; and (3) in accordance with the monetary policy document, revised in January 2015, which requires the authorities to accumulate foreign reserves to cover at least four months of imports in the medium term as well as the countryʹs short-term external debt. When the BOA intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market, its counterparties are the commercial banks; if necessary, it may carry out its intervention with foreign exchange bureaus. The BOA intervenes through (1) verbal intervention, in the form of press releases in the print or electronic media and/or press conferences; and (2) transactional intervention. The latter can take two forms, direct intervention and intervention via preannounced auctions. In the case of direct intervention, the exchange rate is determined by commercial banksʹ quotes and the BOA Monetary Operations Departmentʹs quotes. When the intervention exchange rate is uniform for all counterparties, the BOA publishes that rate on its Reuters page and simultaneously communicates the rate to commercial banks that do not participate in the Reuters system and to foreign exchange bureaus with which it has contact. When different exchange rates are used, the BOA announces only the fact that it has intervened; it publishes with a three-month lag the amount of the intervention in a quarterly bulletin that summarizes its foreign exchange operations with banks and the public sector. The regulation regarding foreign exchange interventions includes the option to carry out transactional interventions via auctions announced in advance. The BOA announces the date, amount, and currency it wants to buy at least one month before the auction, and the banks submit one bid each (in an amount equal to the limit it has provided the BOA). The BOA decides how much to buy based on the rates offered and its target amount. Following the auction, the BOA publishes the amount offered by commercial banks, the amount accepted by the BOA, the range of offered bids, the range of accepted bids, and the prorate at the maximum accepted bid. The exchange rate remained stable in 2014. The current account deficit widened in 2014 due to a higher trade deficit and was mostly financed by higher FDI. BOA and MOF interventions in the foreign exchange market in 2014 account for about 0.6% (1.0% in 2013) of the total volume in this market. The MOF canceled the last two purchasing auctions for 2014 and has not yet published a foreign exchange purchasing auction calendar for 2015. The BOA published a calendar for foreign exchange purchasing auctions in November 2014, with the last auction scheduled for July 2015.The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2014,612,Algeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Bank of Algeria (BA) does not announce the path of the exchange rate. The external value of the dinar is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the BA is the main seller because of significant inflows related to commodity exports, including hydrocarbons, which, under current law, must be surrendered to the BA. The BA manages the dinar with reference to a basket of currencies, and the rate of the dinar relative to the currencies in the basket is based on balance of payments data. The BA has not set a target range for fluctuation of the dinar outside or within any particular band, and the observed exchange rate movements do not confirm any constant weights of the currency composite. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BA does not disclose information about its interventions."
2014,614,Angola,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; however, the BNA intervenes in the foreign exchange market through auctions and direct sales. The BNA receives foreign currency from taxes paid by oil companies to the government, and it buys foreign exchange from banks that process payments to residents for services provided to the oil sector. The BNA then sells the foreign currency to the market (through auctions or direct sales), with special focus on the oil sector. The BNA monitors exchange rate fluctuations to maintain price stability in the economy given the high pass-through of the exchange rate to prices. In 2014, the kwanza remained stable but has gradually been losing value (about 20% a year) since late September. International reserves have been used to smooth the devaluation, declining by about US$3½ billion since the end of June 2014, to US$28 billion at the end of 2014. Because the exchange rate started a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar at the end of September 2014, with about 12% depreciation by the end of April 2015, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified from a stabilized arrangement to a crawl-like arrangement, effective September 17, 2014. The BNA publishes the auction results and respective reference rates."
2014,311,Antigua and Barbuda,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Antigua and Barbuda participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2014,213,Argentina,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, and the exchange rate of the peso, which is determined in the MULC by supply and demand, applies to all transactions in foreign exchange and foreign currency banknotes. The BCRA intervenes in the foreign exchange market to carry out its reserve accumulation and management policy, which acts as a stabilizer during temporary changes in conditions (the BCRA publishes the net purchase volume in a weekly report on foreign exchange positions). According to the BCRA, foreign exchange interventions aim at reducing excessive volatility in the market and avoiding adverse effects on economic activity. Nevertheless, the BCRA makes no explicit or implicit commitment with respect to the exchange rate level or pathway. During May 2014–April 2015, the peso continued to follow a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% margin. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2014,911,Armenia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility, defined as short-term, high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by speculative or trend-following elements rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. Since March 2013, the dram has appreciated within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with one realignment in February 2014. Although exchange rate volatility increased beginning in November 2014 and depreciated 16%, reaching dram 474 per U.S. dollar by December 31, 2014, the new trend requires further observation, and the de facto exchange rate arrangement is still classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBA intervenes anonymously through the stock exchange, but it may also intervene openly in the interbank market, or via auctions of foreign exchange. The CBA publishes weekly intervention data on its website every Monday."
2014,314,Aruba,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The legal documents that established the fixed exchange rate arrangement are AB 1992 No. GT 6 State Decree for Fixing Parity of the Aruban florin and Notice on Foreign Exchange Transactions 90/A2.
2014,193,Australia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"Both the de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as free floating. However, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) retains discretionary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market and has done so during periods of significant market disorder and/or gross misalignment of the exchange rate. Given the high level of development of the Australian foreign exchange market, interventions have been rare. The most recent period of intervention was in 2007–08 and was in response to episodes of significant market disorder—that is, instances when market functioning was impaired to such a degree that it was clear that the observed volatility was excessive. The RBA may also vary the way intervention is conducted; it may enter the interbank foreign exchange market directly through voice or electronic brokerage platforms or use an agent bank. As a matter of government policy, most wholesale purchases of foreign currency by government agencies are made through the RBA. The RBA manages the flows from purchases on behalf of the government so as to minimize their market impact—e.g., by executing these trades when the market is liquid and, if necessary, breaking up the required purchases into a series of smaller transactions. Monthly purchases and sales of foreign exchange are published on the RBA website. Daily data on foreign exchange market interventions are published on the RBA website annually, following the release of the RBA Annual Report."
2014,122,Austria,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Austria participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17 as of January 1, 2014) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2014,912,Azerbaijan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. Effective February 16, 2015, the CBA implemented an exchange rate policy based on the currency basket comprising the U.S. dollar and the euro. Previously a bilateral peg against the U.S. dollar had been in place since January 2011. The CBA influences the market exchange rate by intervening in the foreign exchange market to maintain the official rate within a prescribed corridor. This corridor is not announced. The CBA publishes its foreign exchange intervention data quarterly. Effective February 21, 2015, the CBA devalued the currency by 25% relative to the U.S. dollar. As a result of official action, the manat has remained stable vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as stabilized."

2014,513,Bangladesh,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating since May 31, 2003. The Bangladesh Bank (BB) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to contain undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Following a sharp depreciation of the taka against the U.S. dollar in 2011, the exchange rate was relatively stable from March through November 2012, owing to improved balance of payments conditions and periodic intervention by the BB. Beginning in December 2012, the taka followed an appreciating trend for a short period of three months as a result of increased foreign exchange inflows, and stabilized afterward within a 2% band beginning in February 2013. The de facto exchange rate arrangement has been classified as a stabilized arrangement. The BB publishes information on its interventions in its periodic publications (e.g. Annual Report)."
2014,316,Barbados,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The minister of finance, after consultation with the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), pegged the Barbados dollar to the U.S. dollar on July 5, 1975, pursuant to the Exchange Control Act and the Central Bank of Barbados Act. Intervention data are published in Economic and Financial Statistics Section H, Table 2."
2014,913,Belarus,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating. Beginning in September 19, 2012, the Belarusian rubel followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band. Effective January 9, 2015, the NBRB made the transition to a more flexible exchange rate policy that calls for minimizing currency interventions over the medium term while limiting daily volatility in the value of the currency basket. To this end, an operational rule is applied that limits the ability of the NBRB to influence the setting of the exchange rate. Currency interventions are used to reduce the volatility of the exchange rate, and not to regulate its level. In terms of the structure of the currency basket, the share of the Russian ruble has been increased to 40%, while the shares of the euro and the U.S. dollar are each equal to 30%. During December 2014–January 2015, the Belarusian rubel was devalued in three steps of about 7% each time. Subsequently, the degree of control over the exchange rate appears to have been loosened and further depreciation of the rubel was allowed. While the rubel departed from the 2% band against the U.S. dollar, further observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a crawl-like arrangement."

Benin participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2014,514,Bhutan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. No current legal documents establish a fixed exchange rate arrangement; the ngultrum has been pegged at par to the Indian rupee since the introduction of the ngultrum in 1974. Under the Royal Monetary Authority Act of Bhutan 2010 (Provisions 88 and 89), the Bhutanese government, on recommendation of the RMA, may declare the external value of the ngultrum, and the RMA will determine the appropriate external value. The RMA does not publish the intervention data."
2014,218,Bolivia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling peg to the U.S. dollar (also called a “sliding” rate officially) and is characterized by small movements that are not announced in advance. The Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) determines the floor price on the daily competitive foreign exchange auction (bolsín) in which the financial system participates. The CBB ensures that the rate is consistent with moderate inflation, thus mitigating external and internal inflation pressure, since the exchange rate is still used as a benchmark for the price of nontradable goods, albeit to a decreasing extent due to dedollarization in real and financial transactions. Within the scope of the official crawling peg exchange rate regime, in an external environment characterized by marked exchange rate volatility and decreasing external inflation, the sliding rate was set at zero to prevent misalignment of the real exchange rate with its long-term trend. Because the boliviano stabilized anew against the U.S. dollar since November 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The authorities consider that the de facto stabilized arrangement does not fully characterize the CBBʹs exchange rate administration because the official policy of a crawling peg has not changed. The CBBʹs crawling peg mechanism allows the sliding rate to be set to zero without any regime change if the underlying economic fundamentals warrant it. The CBB publishes data on its exchange market interventions and foreign exchange purchases and sales in the “Weekly Statistics” section of its website."
2014,963,Bosnia and Herzegovina,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The CB covers base money with its foreign reserves, including currency in circulation and commercial bank deposits.

There are no restrictions on the purchase and sale of foreign exchange. The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) publishes data on its sales and purchases."
2014,616,Botswana,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as a crawling peg. The official exchange rate of the pula is determined according to a weighted basket of currencies comprising the SDR and the South African rand. The crawl rate is set as the difference between the Bank of Botswanaʹs (BOBʹs) inflation objective and the inflation forecast in major trading partner countries. The crawl rate is thus determined using a forward-looking approach and is revised regularly. In this approach, the authorities periodically determine the crawl rate for the subsequent period, such as the next 6 or 12 months. Effective January 26, 2015, the weights of the basket changed to 50% for the South African rand and 50% for the SDR (in 2014, 55% and 45%, respectively), and the rate of change was set to zero—previously 0.16%."
2014,223,Brazil,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. There is no official exchange rate for Brazil as the exchange rate of the real is defined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) intervenes to smooth out excessive volatility. Intervention data are available in the CBBʹs weekly publication on currency flows on the CBB website.

The Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD) issues Brunei dollars and manages the Currency Fund, which is used to back up the currency in circulation. Under the Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA), signed in 1967, which remains in effect between the AMBD and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the monetary authorities agree to the mutual exchange of their currency at par without charge. Government authorities and banks must accept each otherʹs currency at par, and the currencies are customary tender in both countries. Excess currency is repatriated regularly, with the cost borne by the currency-issuing authority. The AMBD must ensure that reserves in the Currency Fund cover at least 100% of the currency in circulation. The AMBD publishes data on the reserves used to cover the currency in circulation in its annual report."
2014,918,Bulgaria,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board, which was introduced by the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) of June 1997. The lev was fixed initially to the German mark and subsequently to the euro. The 1997 law was a conceptually new legal act, introducing the currency board mechanism, and cannot be considered an amendment to the previous law of the same name, which was in effect until 1997 and repealed by the new law. Aggregate data for daily euro-lev turnover between the BNB and local banks are published on Reuters page NBOB3. Yearly aggregates are available in the annual report."

The new regulations governing the interbank foreign exchange market allow the BRB to intervene on its own initiative in accordance with market conditions. Because the Burundi franc stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar during 2014, with one realignment in October, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been classified as a stabilized arrangement."

Given the high degree of financial dollarization, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to accommodate demand for riel and maintain exchange rate stability. As of January 2014, the riel has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with one realignment in June 2014. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from other managed to a stabilized arrangement, effective January 1, 2014. Detailed intervention data are available on request."

2014,156,Canada,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, with the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar determined by supply and demand. However, under an intervention policy established by the government in close consultation with the Bank of Canada (BOC), the BOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market on behalf of the government to counter disruptive short-term movements in the exchange rate. The current policy is to intervene on a discretionary, rather than systematic, basis and only in exceptional circumstances. Intervention might be considered if there were signs of a serious near-term market breakdown (e.g., extreme price volatility with buyers or sellers increasingly unwilling to transact), indicating a severe lack of liquidity in the Canadian-dollar market, or in order to help stabilize the currency and signal a commitment to back up intervention with further policy action, as necessary, if extreme currency movements seriously threatened sustainable long-term growth of the Canadian economy. The last time the BOC intervened was as part of the concerted intervention with authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan to counter an excessively strong yen following the March 2011 earthquake in Japan. Earlier, the BOC intervened in September 1998 to influence movements in the Canadian dollar. Interventions are announced on the BOCʹs website, and the amount of intervention is published in the governmentʹs monthly official press release on international reserves."

2014,228,Chile,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate of the peso is freely determined in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Chile (BCCH) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market, in exceptional circumstances, to keep the currency near its equilibrium value in order to avoid costly future reversals. These interventions take the form of transparent, well-founded measures, including explicit definitions of the periods and amounts involved and clearly explained reasons for the intervention. The BCCH usually announces the amount of foreign exchange it intends to buy or sell in its monthly bulletin. It publishes its auction results daily and its reserves weekly. The BCCH did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2013 or 2014."
2014,924,China,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"China officially maintains a de jure managed floating exchange rate arrangement with a view to keeping the RMB exchange rate stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies to preserve the stability of the Chinese economy and financial markets. Since the Peopleʹs Bank of China (PBC) announced a more flexible exchange rate regime in June 2010 to enhance the effectiveness of monetary policy, the exchange rateʹs variability has increased. Effective March 17, 2014, the floating band of the RMBʹs trading prices against the U.S. dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market was expanded to 2% (previously 1%)—i.e., on each business day, the trading prices of the RMB against the U.S. dollar in the market may fluctuate within a band of ±2% around the midrate released that day by Chinaʹs Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS). The PBC announced that the RMBʹs floating range would be expanded in an orderly manner, based on the developments of the foreign exchange market and economic and financial situation. Effective July 14, 2014, banks may determine their RMB exchange rates to the U.S. dollar to their clients without any limit on the spread, based on market supply and demand (PBC No. 2014/188). Previously, the spread between the maximum spot (cash) selling prices offered and the minimum spot (cash) buying prices of the RMB against the U.S. dollar could not exceed 3% (4%) of the daily midrate. The spread between the highest spot exchange (cash) selling price and the lowest spot exchange (cash) buying price had to contain the dayʹs midrate. Within the official spread range, banks could independently decide the buying and selling prices for spot and cash transactions. Since the expansion of the floating trading band, the RMB exchange rateʹs flexibility has increased; the PBC has largely withdrawn its usual foreign exchange interventions, letting market supply and demand have a greater effect on the exchange rate. The PBC does not publish its intervention data."
2014,233,Colombia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. All foreign exchange transactions are conducted at a market-determined exchange rate; however, the Bank of the Republic (Banco de la República—BR) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to (1) increase the level of international reserves to reduce external vulnerability and improve conditions of access to foreign credit; (2) mitigate fluctuations in the exchange rate that do not clearly reflect the behavior of fundamental economic variables and that may have an adverse impact on inflation and economic activity; and (3) reduce rapid and sustained deviations in exchange rate behavior in order to avoid erratic financial market behavior. The BRʹs interventions are based on the guidelines established by its board of directors. The daily and monthly results of the BRʹs intervention in the foreign exchange market and information regarding each auction are available on its website. Between January 2013 and December 2014, the BR intervened on the foreign exchange market through daily foreign exchange purchase auctions (for more detailed information on the auctions, see III.H.1.a.3: Auction). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement."
2014,632,Comoros,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The Comoros participates in the franc zone area. The Comorian franc is pegged to the euro at the fixed rate of CF 491.96775 per euro; the value of other currencies is based on this fixed rate and on the exchange rates of these currencies in the foreign exchange markets. The exchange rate arrangement is established by the following documents: (1) the monetary November 23, 1979, cooperation agreement between the Comorian and French governments; (2) the November 23, 1998, decision by the European Council of Ministers authorizing France to maintain its monetary arrangements with the CFA area countries and the Comoros; and (3) the January 14, 1999, order of the governor of the Central Bank of Comoros (CBC) on euro–Comorian franc parity. Decree No. 87-005/PR, Regulating Financial Relations between the Comoros and Other Countries and its regulations apply. The government of either the Comoros or France may change the exchange rate arrangement after notification to the other party."
2014,238,Costa Rica,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Effective February 2, 2015, under Article 5 of the legal act adopted during session 5677-2015 of the Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR) board of directors held January 30, 2015, a de jure managed float exchange arrangement was established (previously classified as a crawling band arrangement). Under this arrangement: (1) the BCCR will allow the exchange rate to be freely determined by foreign currency supply and demand, but it may participate in the market in order to meet its own foreign currency requirements and those of the nonbank public sector (NBPS) and, at its discretion, to prevent sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate; (2) the BCCR may carry out direct operations or use foreign currency trading instruments that it deems appropriate, in accordance with current regulations; and (3) in its stabilization transactions in the foreign currency market (Monex), the BCCR will continue to apply intervention rules updated to reflect the amendments established under this resolution. In 2014, the BCCR maintained a band exchange rate system, as determined in October 2006.This band arrangement was characterized in 2014 by an intervention purchasing exchange rate of C 500 per U.S. dollar and an intervention selling exchange rate of C 812.05 per U.S. dollar at the start of the year; the latter increased at a rate of C 0.20 a business day, and its value at the end of 2014 was C 862.05 (representing an increase in the bandʹs width of 72%). At the start of 2014, the weighted average exchange rate for the U.S. dollar in the Monex was C 503.58, and in the 27 subsequent days stood in the vicinity of the lower bound of the band. Beginning on January 29, 2014, the exchange rate registered gradual increases of significant magnitude, rising to C 569.10 on March 11, 2014. During this time, the BCCR carried out foreign currency sales in the Monex of approximately US$300 million in order to limit the intraday volatility of the exchange rate. Effective March 12, 2014, the board of directors of the BCCR expanded its exchange rate intervention policy and approved a second criterion for intervention between days in the event that the exchange rate exhibits behavior inconsistent with the variables that determine its behavior in the medium and long term. This criterion was not used in 2014 and remained unused on the date the current report was issued. From March 11, 2014, to June 30, 2014, the exchange rate against the dollar fell by 4.5% to C 543.49. During the second half of 2014, the price of foreign currency exhibited a downward trend and a lower degree of variability than in the first half of the year, owing in part to (1) the normalization of net flows of private sector foreign currency; (2) the implementation of a new foreign currency management strategy for the NBPS, effective June 26, 2014. Under this new strategy, the BCCR will directly meet the NBPSʹs net daily foreign currency requirements by drawing on its international reserves and will replenish foreign currency through participation in the Monex, on the basis of the BCCRʹs macroeconomic program and the prevailing conditions in the foreign exchange market (seasonal trends in private sector foreign currency flows). The board of directors determined that the balance of the foreign currency budget for the NBPS could not exceed 3% of the balance of the estimated adequate reserves. Effective November 29, 2014, this percentage was increased to 8%. The foreign exchange budget allocations necessary to meet the foreign currency requirements of the NBPS amounted to 8% of the balance of the estimated adequate reserves. Effective July 31, 2014, the BCCR launched a program for the purchase of foreign currency up to US$250 million, established under the revised 2014–15 macroeconomic program. As of December 31, 2014, the balance for the program was US$227 million. At the end of 2014, the weighted average exchange rate in the Monex was C 541.95. In 2014, the colón registered a nominal depreciation of 7.2% from 2013 (determined on the basis of the average exchange rate for both years). Because the exchange rate (ER) has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since April 2014, with a one-time adjustment in June, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to stabilized from an “other managed” arrangement, effective April 7, 2014."

The external value of the koruna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) participates. With inflation below target and continued undershooting expected, the CNB announced November 7, 2013, that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market to weaken the koruna to bring its exchange rate against the euro close to CZK 27. Since then, the koruna traded between CZK 27.0 and CZK 28.33, and stabilized within a 2% band against the euro, with a temporary shift in July 2014. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified from other managed to a stabilized arrangement, effective November 19, 2013."
2014,636,Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Congo franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The BCC, while observing the international reserves target in its monetary program, intervenes to smooth daily fluctuations in the market exchange rate if they exceed ±1.5%. The BCC intervenes through an auction, which is the only operational framework for the BCCʹs transactions with the market. The BCC has intervened on both sides of the market. The franc stabilized against the U.S. dollar beginning in early January 2012. While there were several instances of spikes that moved the exchange rate away from the 2% band against the U.S. dollar in January 2015, further observations are necessary to determine the new trend of the exchange rate. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2014,128,Denmark,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The formal framework for the Danish fixed exchange rate policy is the ERM II. Denmark participates in the ERM II with a central rate of DKr 746.038 per €100. The central rate is a conversion of the central rate vis-à-vis the deutsche mark before the third stage of the EMU and was last adjusted in January 1987. Denmark has entered into an agreement with the ECB and the euro area member countries on a narrower fluctuation band of ±2.25%. In recent years, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) has consistently maintained a stable krone within less than 1% of the central rate. The DNʹs net purchase or sale of foreign currency during a month is published at 4:00 p.m. on the second working day of the following month in the Foreign Exchange and Liquidity press release. The agreement on Denmarkʹs fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro within a narrow fluctuation band of ±2.25% around the central rate in ERM II was concluded at an informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council of September 25–27, 1998, in Vienna, between the ministers of economy and finance and the CB governors of the EU member countries."

Dominica participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2014,243,Dominican Republic,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) aims to increase gradually the flexibility of the exchange rate alongside the implementation of the inflation-targeting framework formally adopted in 2012. The CBDR intervenes in the foreign exchange market to avoid instances of excessive exchange rate volatility that might affect the inflation target given that the exchange rate pass-through remains high. Since February 2010, the peso has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBDR publishes data on foreign exchange sales and purchases in the foreign exchange market by different institutional actors (banks, exchange houses, and remittance houses). The data are published on a gross (all transactions) basis and a net basis (excluding interbank operations). The CBDR does not disclose data on its volume of foreign exchange transactions with banks."
2014,248,Ecuador,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Ecuador is the U.S. dollar, which circulates freely. All monetary and financial transactions and operations and their attendant accounting records carried out in Ecuador must be denominated in U.S. dollars, in conformance with Article 43 of the Organic Monetary and Financial Code. The circulation, exchange, withdrawal, and destruction of U.S. dollars, legal tender in Ecuador, are the exclusive domain of the CBE, in accordance with the provisions of this code and the regulation issued by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulatory Board. The CBE is required to satisfy demand for liquidity in Ecuador in a timely manner so as to ensure the normal course of economic transactions. To that end, it is authorized to make necessary remittances, which are not deemed imports or exports. Such transactions carried out by the CBE are exempt from all taxes. Effective February 27, 2015, pursuant to Resolution No. 005-2014-M, electronic currency is placed in circulation exclusively by the CBE, backed by its liquid assets, based on policies and regulations issued by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulatory Board. The CBE is the only entity authorized to provide and manage national or electronic metallic currency in Ecuador equivalent and convertible to U.S. dollars, in accordance with the provisions of this code and the regulation and authorization of the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulatory Board. The currency referred to in this article is a means of payment. The currency is unrestricted legal tender with unlimited redeemability in Ecuador in accordance with the regulations issued by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulatory Board. The government may not require a private individual or legal entity to accept any currency other than the U.S. dollar."
2014,469,Egypt,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The interbank system was launched December 23, 2004. This system created depth and liquidity in the market by bringing buyers and sellers together on one transparent platform. According to the interbank convention, banks exchange foreign currency with each other; hence the official exchange rate is determined through the interaction of supply and demand in the market. In late 2012, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) introduced the multiple price foreign exchange auction mechanism through which the CBE can inject into or drain foreign currency from the domestic market. Currently, the official market comprises both the interbank market and the foreign exchange auction mechanism. The official exchange rate is calculated as the weighted average of the interbank market and CBE auction results. Between July 3, 2013, and January 18, 2015, the pound stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with one realignment in May 2014. Although the exchange rate appears to have departed from the 2% band against the U.S. dollar, further observation is necessary to determine the new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a stabilized arrangement."

2014,915,Georgia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Georgia is floating. The NBG intervenes in the foreign exchange market through foreign exchange auctions, but does not make any explicit or implicit commitment with respect to an exchange rate target or path. Foreign exchange purchase auctions have been directed toward rebuilding foreign exchange reserves, an objective of the authoritiesʹ economic program that is supported by an IMF stand-by arrangement. In 2014, the NBG sold about US$100 million in foreign exchange. Between November 2014 and the end of year the lari depreciated by about 6% against the U.S. dollar. As of the end of March 2015 depreciation amounted to almost 28%. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. The amount sold at the NBGʹs foreign exchange auctions and the average exchange rates are posted on the NBG website shortly after each auction."

2014,258,Guatemala,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. In accordance with the Monetary Law and the Free Foreign Exchange Convertibility Law, Guatemala has a flexible exchange rate arrangement under which the rate is determined in the foreign exchange market by supply and demand. However, the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene to limit volatility in the nominal exchange rate without affecting its trend. The BOG intervenes through foreign exchange auctions based on a transparent rule that limits daily volatility. Effective January 1, 2014, the fluctuation margin (added to or subtracted from the five-day moving average of the exchange rate) that determines whether the BOG may intervene was increased from 0.65% to 0.70%. The BOG may also intervene whenever the nominal exchange rate shows unusual volatility. The quetzal showed reduced volatility and stayed within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with an appreciating trend between November 16, 2012, and mid-May 2013, and a depreciating trend until October 28, 2013, after which it resumed an appreciating path until the end of 2014. Market supply and demand play a role in determining the exchange rate, as does official action based on the observed path of the rate and the high volume of BOG participation in the foreign exchange auctions. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. Intervention data are available on the BOGʹs website."
2014,656,Guinea,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Guinea announced its participation in the exchange rate mechanisms (ERM and ERM II) of the WAMZ, which formally limits the fluctuation of the franc to ±15% around a central rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, but this has yet to be implemented. The Central Bank of the Republic of Guinea (CBRG) intervenes once a week through a foreign exchange auction market with active commercial banks. However, a structural excess demand of foreign exchange is not reflected in the exchange rate set during the weekly auctions. Commercial banksʹ transactions with their customers must be within a band of ±3% around the most recent weekly auction rate. Although the volatility of the franc has increased since February 2015, further observation is necessary to determine the new trend. Until that determination, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a stabilized arrangement. The CBRG regularly publishes information regarding foreign exchange market interventions."
2014,654,Guinea-Bissau,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Guinea-Bissau participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed on September 20, 2005."
2014,336,Guyana,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; the exchange rate of the Guyanese dollar is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Guyana (BOG) periodically purchases foreign currency from foreign exchange dealers in order to maintain international reserves at acceptable levels. In accordance with bilateral agreements with the CARICOM CBs, the BOG quotes weekly rates for certain CARICOM currencies. Reflecting the stability of the Guyanese dollar against the U.S. dollar as a result of interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2014,263,Haiti,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement has been classified as a crawl-like arrangement since April 2008, except for a disruption in the foreign exchange market after the January 2010 earthquake, during which the gourde was classified as other managed arrangement from January through February 2010. In 2014, the gourde continued on a slightly depreciating path within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Foreign exchange sales and purchases by the Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) are used to smooth exchange rate fluctuations. The BRH publishes information on foreign exchange interventions weekly on its website."
2014,268,Honduras,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling band. The exchange rate of the lempira is determined by foreign exchange auctions of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). The BCH maintains an operational band requiring all bid prices for the purchase of foreign exchange to be within a range of 7% above or below the base price, with the requirement that bids in auction not exceed 1% of the average base price of the auctions of the preceding seven business days (Resolution No. 271-7/2013 of the BCH). The base price is calculated weekly according to a procedure established by the BCH board of directors for this purpose, which includes the following variables: (1) the differential between the domestic inflation rate and the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners, (2) changes in the exchange rates of these countriesʹ currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and (3) the performance of official reserve assets. The external inflation rate is considered to be the weighted average of the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners. Domestic inflation is measured by the consumer price index. The change in the U.S. dollar exchange rates of the main trading partners is measured using the effective exchange rate index, which is compiled weekly based on the weighted average of the main trading partnersʹ exchange rates expressed in units of their respective currencies to US$1.00. Finally, an adjustment factor is applied to the base price of the auction, depending on the number of months of imports covered by the BCHʹs reserve assets. In July 2011, the BCH (through Resolution No. 284-7/2011 of July 21, 2011) reactivated the crawling band system that had been in operation until mid-2005. As a result, following a long period of stability, the lempira was allowed to crawl once again in July 2011 and thereafter followed a steadily depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar, with a small one-time adjustment in November 2011. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to a crawling peg arrangement, effective July 25, 2011. The BCH publishes its sales of foreign exchange on its website daily."
2014,532,Hong Kong SAR,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires that the monetary base be backed at least 100% by and that changes in it be matched 100% by corresponding changes in the reserve currency (U.S. dollar) at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75–HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—has been in place since May 18, 2005. The monetary base includes issued notes and coins, the balance at the HKMA of banksʹ clearing accounts (i.e., the aggregate balance), and outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Consistent with currency board principles, the HKMA may issue additional Exchange Fund paper when there is an inflow of funds, and the program may expand along with the interest payments on such paper. Issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which back banknotes issued by note-issuing banks (NIBs), must be made against U.S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. Issuance and withdrawal of government-issued notes and coins are settled against U.S. dollars at the same fixed rate. The legal documents that establish the currency board include the Basic Law (Chapter V, Section 1, Articles 110 and 111); the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66); and an exchange of letters between the financial secretary and the HKMA specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system under the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The letters specify that the financial secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system, including the linked exchange rate. Section 3(1) of the ordinance, as amended, specifies that the Exchange Fund “shall be under the control of the Financial Secretary and shall be used primarily for such purposes as the Financial Secretary thinks fit affecting, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong SAR and for other purposes incidental thereto.” The HKMA is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments, and operational means for doing so, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary system. The HKMA makes immediate announcements of the impact on the aggregate balance due to purchases or sales of U.S. dollars by the Currency Board via various information vendors, including Reuters and Bloomberg. The information is also available on the HKMA website."
2014,944,Hungary,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating because of discretionary intervention by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) in the foreign exchange market. The possible objectives of foreign exchange intervention are listed in the MNBʹs intervention strategy, which has not been published. The strategy aims to avoid disruptive market fluctuations and exchange rate overshooting. However, the strategy emphasizes that the MNB generally refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange market. The MNB converts foreign currency for the government and net current and capital transfers from the EU at market rates. These transactions change the foreign exchange reserve position of the MNB. If the resulting reserve dynamics are not in line with the MNBʹs reserve management objectives, some of the funds are channeled to the market. Transactions are small and conducted at market prices. The MNB announced the policy of channeling the foreign exchange position resulting from EU transfers several times in the past, most recently in March 2009 for that year. Until 2009, the net amounts were published quarterly in the MNBʹs quarterly and annual reports."
2014,176,Iceland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. In 2014, the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) continued to follow the strategy of increased foreign exchange market intervention as set forth by the Monetary Policy Committee in May 2013. CBI transactions accounted for about 43% of total market turnover, up from 12% in 2013, and total turnover increased by more than 60% year over year. The objective of the intervention strategy is to mitigate short-term exchange rate volatility and expand the CBIʹs nonborrowed reserves inasmuch as conditions allow. Exchange rate volatility diminished significantly after the strategy was announced. The spread between the highest and lowest exchange rates was 4.4%, as opposed to 12% in 2013. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement."
2014,534,India,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is largely market determined, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market to manage excessive volatility and maintain orderly conditions without any fixed target or band for the exchange rate. The RBI publishes monthly data on its interventions (foreign exchange purchases and sales) in its monthly bulletin with a six-week lag."
2014,536,Indonesia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating (adopted August 14, 1997). The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Bank Indonesia (BI), however, may intervene—as part of a policy mix—whenever necessary to achieve the inflation target and to maintain macroeconomic stability. When it intervenes, the BI does not target a specific rate or maintain exchange rate movements within a specific band; rather it provides liquidity to maintain market stability. The BI does not disclose data on its interventions. Since August 2013, the rupiah has moved more freely. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement."
2014,433,Iraq,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements have been retroactively reclassified to a conventional peg arrangement, effective January 15, 2012 (previously classified as de jure floating and de facto stabilized). The Central Bank Law gives the Board of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) the authority to formulate exchange rate policy, and the board has maintained its policy to keep the official exchange rate at ID 1,166 per U.S. dollar since January 15, 2012. Effective February 16, 2014, the CBI set the cash exchange rate at ID 1,190 per U.S. dollar, LC exchange rate at ID 1,184 per U.S. dollar, and transfer transaction rate at ID 1,187 per U.S. dollar. The CBI stands ready to provide foreign exchange at the official exchange rate plus commissions for permissible transactions through its daily auctions (allocations), establishing a peg. However, because certain transactions are excluded from access to the CBI auctions, many transactions take place at parallel market exchange rates. The CBI publishes the daily volume of the auction allocation on its website."
2014,178,Ireland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Ireland participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members of the EU (previously 17 as of January 1, 2014) and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2014,429,Islamic Republic of Iran,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a managed floating arrangement against a basket of currencies since 2002. From September 2012 to July 2013, the rial traded at three different rates—an official appreciated rate for imports of priority goods, a second official rate for the sale of oil export receipts and imports of other essential goods, and a flexible bureau rate for the sale of nonoil exports and imports of all remaining goods. The authorities unified the two official exchange rates at the more depreciated rate in July 2013, after the premium between the depreciated official and bureau rates remained about 30%. From July 2013 to March 2014, the sole remaining official rate stayed stable against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been retroactively reclassified to stabilized from other managed, effective July 3, 2013. The change is reflected as of January 1, 2014, corresponding to the first day of the period covered in this yearʹs Annual Report on Exchange Arrangements and Exchange Restrictions. From March 2014 until the end of the year, the official exchange rate resumed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with one realignment in July 2014. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been retroactively reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from stabilized, effective March 24, 2014."
2014,436,Israel,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the Bank of Israel (BOI) announced in August 2009 that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market in the event of unusual movements in the exchange rate that are inconsistent with underlying economic conditions or when conditions in the foreign exchange market are disorderly. The BOI did not intervene in the foreign exchange market from August 2011 through March 2013. In April 2013, the BOI intervened again in the foreign exchange market in line with the foreign exchange policy announced in August 2009. In May 2013, the BOI announced a multiyear foreign exchange purchase plan to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate. The BOI purchased US$7 billion in the foreign exchange market during 2014 (US$5.3 billion in 2013), of which US$3.5 billion (US$2.1 billion in 2013) was part of the purchase plan to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate and the rest was under the foreign exchange policy announced in August 2009. The BOI announced, on December 9, 2014, that it will purchase US$3.1 billion in 2015 in the foreign exchange market to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate. The BOI does not publish daily purchase information. Since May 2013 the BOI has intervened more than three times in a six-month period, so the new shekelʹs de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement."

2014,343,Jamaica,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market, in which the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) intervenes with sales and purchases of foreign currency. The Jamaican dollar has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2% since 2011. Given the pattern of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BOJ publishes information on its interventions in its Annual Report and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report."
2014,158,Japan,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the yen is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disorderly conditions in the market. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Interventions fall within the mandate of the MOF, which publishes daily purchases and sales amounts as well as intervention currencies on its website. The Bank of Japan (BOJ), acting as agent of the minister of finance, intervenes in the market through financial institutions and/or brokers. The last time the MOF intervened in the foreign exchange market was from October 31 through November 4, 2011 (¥9,091.6 billion) to address excess volatility and disorderly exchange rate movement. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating."
2014,439,Jordan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dinar is officially pegged to the SDR, but in practice, it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since late 1995. The CBJ is responsible for maintaining the stability of the dinar exchange rate."
2014,916,Kazakhstan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float since February 2011. The main intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Intervention in the foreign exchange market seeks to smooth out demand and supply fluctuations and is prompted by second-tier banksʹ foreign exchange supply and demand. The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) may conduct foreign exchange operations both in the regulated Kazakhstan Stock Exchange (KASE) and interbank foreign exchange markets. The NBK intervenes on its own behalf directly with market participants based on their quotes and does not publish information on its interventions. Between September 2013 and February 2014, the tenge was managed within an unofficial 2% band against a basket of currencies composed of the U.S. dollar (70%), euro (20%), and Russian ruble (10%). Since February 2014 (following an 18% devaluation against the U.S. dollar), the tenge has stabilized within a 2% range against the U.S. dollar (notwithstanding an asymmetric 6% expansion of the official band as of September 11, 2014). On that basis, the de facto exchange rate was reclassified to a stabilized from a crawl-like arrangement, effective February 11, 2014."
2014,664,Kenya,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. Official foreign exchange market interventions aim to moderate the rate of change and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than to establish a particular level. Data on interventions are only partially disclosed. If the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) uses the auction system to intervene, the market is informed of the amount dealt and the average rate. (The average rate is published after the auction closes.) If the CBK chooses to intervene directly (i.e. by buying or selling foreign exchange from or to banks directly through the Reuters Dealing System), the market is informed but amounts and rates are not published. Since 2012, the shilling has experienced relative stability with limited volatility. Given the frequency of interventions in the foreign exchange market, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2014,826,Kiribati,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. There is no central monetary institution, and the authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange. The Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Bank (Kiribati) Limited, the only commercial bank, quotes daily rates for 15 currencies on the basis of their respective rates against the Australian dollar."
2014,542,Korea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the won is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. As such, the system is managed in accordance with the principles defined by the free floating system, and the governmentʹs role is very limited to remain within the range allowed by the free floating system. However, because of the lack of information on the authoritiesʹ interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Korea (BOK) may intervene in the market with the funds of the BOK and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund when it is deemed necessary for the stability of the market. Interventions in the spot market or through derivatives in the forward market are not announced, and intervention data are not published."
2014,967,Kosovo,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The euro is legal tender and circulates freely.
2014,443,Kuwait,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. According to the law of the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK), the exchange rate arrangement is specified by an “amiri” decree in consultation with the governor of the CBK (see CBK Law, Chapter I, Article II). The arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. Intervention data are not disclosed to the public."
2014,917,Kyrgyz Republic,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The NBKR participates in the interbank foreign exchange market and makes interventions as needed to smooth out exchange rate fluctuations. During 2014, the som generally followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a narrow band with periods of divergence. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The NBKR publishes information on its website about its daily purchases and sales of foreign exchange."
2014,544,Lao P.D.R.,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. During the first quarter of 2013, the kip appreciated rapidly, reaching its lowest point in May at KN 7,672.15 per U.S. dollar, followed by a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. In 2014, the exchange rate depreciated at a lower rate, but it increased beginning in December 2014. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2014,941,Latvia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Latvia participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17 as of January 1, 2014) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2014,446,Lebanon,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is free floating. In practice, the exchange rate remains within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Banque du Liban (BDL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market daily from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and from 10:00 a.m. until noon on Friday. The BDL does not publish intervention data."
2014,666,Lesotho,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The loti is pegged to the South African rand at M 1 per rand. The exchange rate is 1:1, backed by the net international reserves position in excess of 120% of M1."
2014,668,Liberia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to counter speculative movements. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement since November 2011, when the exchange rate departed from the stabilized band, showing increased but limited flexibility while still being managed. The foreign exchange auction data (volume, price, etc.) are published on the CBL website."
2014,672,Libya,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the SDR. Since March 2014, the dinar has followed an appreciating trend within a 2% band against the SDR. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a crawl-like from a conventional peg arrangement, effective March 12, 2014."
2014,946,Lithuania,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Effective January 1, 2015, Lithuania participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17 as of January 1, 2014) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers. Thus, effective January 1, 2015, following the adoption of the euro the de facto exchange rate arrangement of Lithuania has been reclassified to the category free floating from the category currency board. Previously, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was a currency board. The currency board was established by the Law on Credibility of the Litas and was in effect since April 1, 1994. The litas exchange rate against the euro was fixed by the Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania approving the proposal of the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) regarding the anchor currency and the litas official exchange rate (February 1, 2002, No. 157) and the Resolution of the Bank of Lithuania on the Anchor Currency and the Official Exchange Rate of the Litas (February 1, 2002, No. 15)."

When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2014,674,Madagascar,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the official interbank market. The Central Bank of Madagascar (CBM) intervenes in the interbank market to smooth large exchange rate fluctuations and meet foreign reserve targets. Information on CBM daily interventions is not publicly available. Only the weighted average daily rate and the number and amount of transactions are made available to the public through the CBM official site. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating.
2014,676,Malawi,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Official intervention focuses on building foreign reserves and limiting exchange rate volatility while taking into account seasonal fluctuations. In May 2012, the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) devalued the kwacha from MK 168 to MK 250 per U.S. dollar. In anticipation of this devaluation, the RBM took steps aimed at allowing market forces to determine the exchange rate and at improved availability of foreign exchange in the market. Since May 2012, the RBM has not set a target rate and allowed substantial exchange rate volatility. The exchange rate stability from April to September 2014 can be attributed to excess supply of foreign exchange during the tobacco marketing season and the deliberate policy of the RBM to buy excess dollars over and above private sector demand offered by AD banks throughout the period. Once the tobacco marketing season ended, the exchange rate depreciated 24% from mid-September to November 2014 and had appreciated afterward about 11% as of February 2015. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The kwacha appears to have stabilized anew since mid-February 2015, but further observation is necessary to determine the new trend of the exchange rate. Until then, the de facto arrangement remains classified as floating."
2014,548,Malaysia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) operates a de jure managed float for the ringgit with reference to a currency basket. The composition of the basket is not disclosed. Because the ringgit tracks a composite, although not closely enough to be classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BNM does not publish its intervention data. The BNM also does business directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers at rates it deems fit for maintaining orderly market conditions without targeting any particular level of the exchange rate."
2014,556,Maldives,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Since 2011, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. This regime allows the rufiyaa to float within a 20% band around a central parity of Rf 12.85 per U.S. dollar. However, the rufiyaa remained stabilized in a narrow band against the U.S. dollar near the ceiling of the band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Under the Maldives Monetary Authority Act, the president may decide to change the exchange rate arrangement and adjust the exchange rate."
2014,678,Mali,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Mali participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."

2014,682,Mauritania,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The ouguiya was previously de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar, at an exchange rate of UM 268.6 per U.S. dollar (October 24, 2005, through January 25, 2007). Since 2007, the new foreign exchange market uses a fixing system in which the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) intervenes. The BCM intervenes in order to regulate the exchange market according to its exchange rate policy objectives (smoothing the exchange rate and the projected level of official reserves). Since November 2013, the ouguiya has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with two realignments, one on March 24, 2014, and the other on May 28, 2014. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was retroactively reclassified from other managed to a stabilized arrangement, effective November 20, 2013. A summary statement of market turnover data is updated daily on the BCM website."
2014,684,Mauritius,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand in the domestic foreign exchange market and by international factors. Interventions by the BOM in the foreign exchange market are limited to smoothing volatility and do not aim to offset market forces. Because the BOM intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market on both an auction basis and at fixed rates, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Information regarding interventions is published regularly on the BOM website and in its publications."
2014,273,Mexico,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating; the exchange rate of the peso is determined in the foreign exchange market. Effective December 8, 2014, the Foreign Exchange Commission announced that Banco de Mexico (BM) would auction up to US$200 million daily at a minimum exchange rate equivalent to the reference exchange rate (FIX) of the preceding business day in accordance with BM provisions, plus 1.5%. Thus, the auction results in assignment only if the rate depreciates at least 1.5% between sessions. As of March 11, 2015, this mechanism had been used twice (December 11, 2014; March 6, 2015). Effective March 11, 2015, the Foreign Exchange Commission announced that the BM would auction US$52 million daily at no minimum price until June 8, 2015 (extended to September 29, 2015, on May 22, 2015). The auction process announced December 8, 2014, by the Foreign Exchange Commission continues. The BM reserves the right to make extraordinary sales of foreign exchange if necessary due to market conditions."
2014,868,Micronesia,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Micronesia is the U.S. dollar. The authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange.
2014,921,Moldova,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Moldova (NBM) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the leu against the U.S. dollar. Sharp fluctuations are not specifically defined; however, the NBM intervenes based on market conditions and future expectations of market participants. These interventions do not aim to change the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM intervenes directly at the market-quoted rates and publishes aggregated monthly data on its website regarding its interventions and interbank market turnover. The data show interventions by currency and type of operation (spot or derivative)."
2014,948,Mongolia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The BOM reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market using the U.S. dollar as the principal intervention currency. The BOM intervenes through the auction to limit day-to-day exchange rate volatility in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. The BOM publishes the cutoff rate for each auction on its website.
2014,943,Montenegro,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The euro is legal tender.
2014,686,Morocco,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a composite. Since April 2001, the basket has been composed of the euro and the U.S. dollar, with weights of 80% and 20%, respectively. The Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) publishes its monthly foreign exchange purchases and sales on its website. Authority to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is found in Dahir No. 1-05-38 of November 23, 2005, promulgating Law No. 76-03 establishing the charter of the BAM (Chapter II, Missions, Section I, Core missions, Article 8). The exchange arrangement falls within the purview and prerogatives of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The BAM is responsible for its operational implementation (quoted rates, ranges) and any changes and monitors the foreign exchange market."
2014,688,Mozambique,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Both the de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. As a major conduit for foreign aid flows, the Bank of Mozambique (BM) is the main channel for foreign exchange into the market. It also intervenes to smooth seasonal fluctuations. For its transactions in Mozambiqueʹs interbank foreign exchange market (MCI) the BM uses the quotes shown on the screen for each commercial bank. The BM is therefore a price taker—i.e., it takes the highest foreign exchange selling rate and the lowest buying rate. The BM publishes information on its website regarding foreign exchange transactions in the MCI. It also publishes the schedule of MCI benchmark average exchange rates in the Jornal Notícias and on its website."
2014,518,Myanmar,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. In April 2012, the CBM started daily two-way multiple price foreign currency auctions, which provide a mechanism for the market to determine an exchange rate the CBM can use to set its new reference rate. However, the CBM reserves the right to intervene periodically to mitigate undue exchange rate volatility and support the liquidity of the kyat in the foreign exchange market. The CBM has no predetermined target for the level of the kyat exchange rate or its trading range and expects the value to fluctuate with supply and demand in the market. The CBM has widened the trading band in the wholesale market from ±0.3% to ±0.8% of the CBM reference rate. Beginning in October 2014, the CBM attempted to slow kyat depreciation by setting its reference rate at a more appreciated rate than the parallel market rate, which increased the spread between the two rates significantly. Due to the multiple exchange rates and divergence of these rates from the official rate, the de facto exchange rate regime is classified as other managed arrangement."
2014,728,Namibia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement is the CMA agreement.
2014,558,Nepal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) is designated as the agency that may decide on changes in the exchange rate system. The NRB publishes its intervention data regularly.

When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2014,196,New Zealand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may intervene if the exchange rate is exceptionally high or low, if that rate is not justified by economic fundamentals, and if there is a material prospect that the intervention will influence the exchange rate. Interventions may not be used as an attempt to influence the long-term trend of the exchange rate. The net volume of New Zealand dollars sold by the RBNZ increased from August 2014 through September 2014. As outlined in a speech by the RBNZ governor on September 25, 2014, “New Zealandʹs Exchange Rate: Why the Reserve Bank Believes Its Level Is Unjustified and Unsustainable,” the RBNZ initiated foreign exchange transactions to dampen some of the spikes in the exchange rate in earlier months. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The RBNZ publishes information on its foreign currency assets and liabilities, including its foreign currency intervention capacity (stock of reserves available for intervention) and foreign exchange swap position, on its website but does not publish data on its direct intervention."
2014,278,Nicaragua,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) publishes aggregated monthly data pertaining to BCN foreign exchange transactions with the banks and the government.

2014,694,Nigeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The CBN explicitly aims to maintain an exchange rate principally driven by market forces but intervenes to reduce volatility and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. The midpoint of the target exchange rate is N 168 per U.S. dollar with a soft exchange rate band of ±5%. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The CBN publishes information on its interventions through auction on its website; however, data on interventions in the interbank market are not disseminated. Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires maintaining the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar within ±15% of the central rate, but the CBN has not implemented this regime."
2014,142,Norway,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as free floating; the krone floats freely and independently against other currencies. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Norges Bank (NB) does not normally intervene to influence the exchange rate of the krone; however, it may intervene in the foreign exchange market on short notice if the krone deviates substantially from the level the NB considers reasonable in relation to fundamentals and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target. The NB may also intervene in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level. The NB has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999. Foreign exchange purchases or sales for the Government Pension Fund Global are publicly preannounced on the CB website. In extraordinary circumstances, the NB may provide foreign exchange liquidity via collateralized operations. This was done between September 2008 and July 2009."
2014,449,Oman,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg to the U.S. dollar. According to the Banking Law of 1974, later amended by Royal Decree No. 114/2000, the par value of the rial is determined from time to time by His Majesty The Sultan."
2014,564,Pakistan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) does not explicitly or implicitly commit to an exchange rate target or path. Market intervention has generally been directed toward building foreign exchange reserves and ensuring smooth functioning of the foreign exchange market. Due to limited volatility, with periods of divergence, the de facto exchange rate is classified as other managed arrangement. The SBP does not publish information on its intervention."

2014,853,Papua New Guinea,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the kina is determined in the interbank market, in which ADs participate. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to smooth extreme fluctuations; however, it does not publish information on its interventions. Beginning in April 2014, the exchange rate followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with one realignment in June 2014. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to a crawl-like arrangement from floating, effective April 11, 2014. Effective June 4, 2014, the BPNG introduced an exchange rate trading band with a kina buying rate within 75 basis points above the interbank midrate and a kina selling rate within 75 basis points below the midrate."
2014,288,Paraguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand. The objective of the Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) under Article 3 of Organic Law No. 489/95 is to preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the CBP aims to smooth seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. The CBP intervenes occasionally in the market to smooth the effects of undue fluctuation. The CBP, as the governmentʹs financial agent, receives U.S. dollars from royalties and compensation paid by the binational hydroelectric entities and exchanges them for guaraníes at the request of the government for the purpose of public expenditures. These dollars from the public sector are returned to the market through programmed sales. Accordingly, in July 2013, the CBP implemented a program of preannounced sales of the U.S. dollars it purchases from the government. The new program is more transparent, better communicated, and more consistent with an inflation-targeting regime. This program indicates in advance the nature, frequency, and size of the CBPʹs foreign exchange transactions to avoid influencing market expectations of the exchange rate. Every action of the CBP in the exchange market is announced in advance. Data on CBP operations in the market, whether in the form of programmed or supplementary foreign exchange transactions, are updated weekly on the CBPʹs website."
2014,293,Peru,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Peru has a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) is authorized by law to intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility without altering the exchange rate trend. BCRP interventions can also be conducted through dollar-indexed bonds, foreign exchange swaps, and repos. During 2014, the BCRP intervened in the spot and forward markets, which led to a fall in net international reserves (NIR) from US$3.5 billion to US$62.5 billion (31% of GDP) at the end of 2014. Intervention continued through the first quarter of 2015, with a further loss in NIR of US$1 billion. Amid intervention, the nuevo sol depreciated by 6.5% in 2014 (year over year in nominal terms) and by 3% in the first quarter of 2015 (less than the currencies of trading partners and competitors but more than the inflation differential with the U.S.). Foreign exchange intervention amounted to US$4.2 billion in the spot market and US$14 billion in the forward market in 2014. Although the nuevo sol appears to have started a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar from July 2014, with one realignment at the end of January 2015, further observation is necessary to determine the new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange arrangement remains classified as floating. The BCRP publishes daily information about its intervention operations (prices and amounts) on its website."
2014,566,Philippines,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) adheres to a market-determined exchange rate policy with some scope for occasional action solely to prevent potentially disruptive sharp fluctuations. The BSP does not target or support a given level of exchange rate; it allows the value of the peso to be determined by supply and demand. The BSP may participate in the U.S. dollar–peso market directly with market participants or via market makers and does not disclose intervention data, which are for internal use only. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Data on currency swaps settled in foreign currency and nondeliverable forwards settled in domestic currency are reported monthly in Sections II and IV, respectively, of the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which is posted on the BSP website."
2014,964,Poland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the zloty is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, and the zloty is traded freely against all currencies. The Narodowy Bank Polski (NBP), however, may intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary to ensure domestic macroeconomic and financial stability, which is conducive to meeting the inflation target in the medium term. Given that the NBP intervened in the foreign exchange market only once in 2013, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. The NBP did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2014. In addition, the MOF has continued sale of foreign currency funds partially in the foreign exchange market (sale of foreign currency funds in the CB was also used)."
2014,182,Portugal,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Portugal participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17 as of January 1, 2014) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2014,453,Qatar,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The targeted peg was officially authorized by Amiri Decree No. 34 of 2001 issued in July 2001, replacing the de jure exchange rate policy of pegging to the SDR, which had been in effect since 1975. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) does not publish data on its interventions."
2014,634,Republic of Congo (Congo),973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. The Republic of Congo participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CEMAC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (Joint Monetary Committee) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to amend the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2014,968,Romania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) may intervene to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations. There is no formal definition of excessive exchange rate fluctuations: the assessment is based on domestic and international market circumstances and on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The NBR intervenes either directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers. The NBR does not publish information on its interventions. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement.
2014,922,Russia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Effective November 10, 2014, the Bank of Russia (BR) eliminated its exchange rate corridor and canceled regular foreign exchange interventions, adopting a de jure floating exchange rate regime (previously a de jure other managed). Under this arrangement, the BR does not interfere with the development of trends in the dynamics of the rubleʹs exchange rate against foreign currencies as a result of fundamental macroeconomic factors and does not restrict the level of the rubleʹs exchange rate or target values for changes in the exchange rate. Accordingly, the de facto exchange arrangement was reclassified from other managed to a floating arrangement. The BR may intervene in the domestic foreign exchange market only if risks to financial stability arise, and in connection with the replenishment or expenditure of sovereign funds. The annual schedule of auctions to supply foreign currency is posted on the BR website: repo auctions are held weekly, and auctions to provide foreign currency credits are held monthly. Limits on operations as well as the outcome of the auctions are announced by the BR through the posting of messages on the website before and after the auctions are held, respectively."
2014,714,Rwanda,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has intervened directly in order to prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Since the end of September 2013, the franc has followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar with several short periods of stability and only one episode of spikes lasting less than five days a quarter. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective September 24, 2013. The BNR discloses data on its interventions in the foreign exchange market."
2014,862,Samoa,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) does not publish data on its interventions. Currently, there is no legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement, except the CBS Act of 1984, which states only that the CBS is responsible for setting the exchange rate."
2014,135,San Marino,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. On March 27, 2012, San Marino signed a monetary agreement with the EU repealing the previous monetary agreement of November 29, 2000. The agreement authorizes San Marino to use the euro as its official currency, grant legal tender status to euro banknotes and coins, and issue limited quantities of euro coins. San Marino is committed to adopting the relevant EU legislation (on euro banknotes and coins; combating fraud and counterfeiting; banking and financial legislation, including the prevention of money laundering and statistical reporting requirements) within the time specified by that agreement (one to six years from the effective date—Decree No. 120 of August 7, 2012)."
2014,716,São Tomé and Príncipe,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg against the euro. Beginning February 1, 2009, the focus of the BCSTP switched from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which became the new reference currency for the peg on January 1, 2010. The organic law of the BCSTP authorizes it to make decisions regarding exchange rate policy."
2014,456,Saudi Arabia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rate of the riyal against the U.S. dollar is determined by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) and has been stable since June 1986. The SAMA, in coordination with the minister of finance, decides on changes in the exchange rate arrangement. Historically, the SAMA has not published its intervention data."
2014,722,Senegal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Senegal participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2014,942,Serbia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"In accordance with the revised IMF classification system of exchange rate arrangements, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The current Decision on the Dinar Exchange Rate Regime stipulates “managed floating.” Since the introduction of this exchange rate regime in 2001 and in accordance with its commitment to liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has tried to reduce its participation in the foreign exchange market and to adjust the features of the existing exchange rate regime in the direction of soft managed floating, so as to pave the way for a freely floating exchange rate regime in the future. This exchange rate regime enables the NBS to balance, when necessary, foreign exchange demand and supply and moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate in either direction (appreciation or depreciation) that may occur under the influence of external or internal shocks to the national economy. The NBS interventions do not aim to achieve a particular level of the exchange rate. Interventions in the foreign exchange market take place only to moderate excessive daily short-term volatility of the exchange rate of the dinar, in either direction (appreciation or depreciation), in order to contain threats to financial and price stability and safeguard an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2014,718,Seychelles,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand in the market. The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) intervenes only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility. The CBS occasionally participates in the foreign exchange market for reserve accumulation. Operational guidelines designate the CBS as the buyer and seller of last resort in the foreign exchange market. Given the rupeeʹs increased volatility and departure from the 2% band against the U.S. dollar in April 2014, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from a crawl-like arrangement to floating, effective March 27, 2014. The CBS discloses intervention data on its website, which is publicly accessible."
2014,724,Sierra Leone,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating, and the exchange rate of the leone is market determined. The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) does not target a specific level of the exchange rate. Occasionally, it buys or sells foreign exchange in the market to build up its reserves and sells to the market as part of its open market operations through the foreign exchange auction. The BSL publishes the amount of foreign exchange it offers weekly for auction and the result of the weekly foreign exchange auction in the print media, on the radio, and on its website. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2014,576,Singapore,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. The authorities manage the exchange rate as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the objective of maintaining price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. The Singapore dollar is allowed to fluctuate within a targeted policy band and is managed against a basket of currencies of the countryʹs major trading partners and competitors. Currencies in the basket are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the countries in Singaporeʹs trade relations with the world. The exchange rate policy is announced every six months in the Monetary Policy Statement, typically in terms of changes to the slope, central rate, and width of the policy band. In response to changing macroeconomic conditions, the policy parameters may also be adjusted outside the regular biannual cycle. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. In 2014, the Singapore dollar remained stable within a 2% band against a currency composite. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) intervenes through agents and does not publish information on its interventions."
2014,936,Slovak Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. The Slovak Republic participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17 as of January 1, 2014) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2014,961,Slovenia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Slovenia participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17 as of January 1, 2014) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2014,813,Solomon Islands,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime pegs the Solomon Islands dollar (SBD) to a basket of currencies. The policy aims to ensure price stability and maintain a managed exchange rate policy in line with economic fundamentals and offer some flexibility. The SBD was expected to fluctuate on a daily basis but within a managed ±1% band around the base rate. In May 2014, the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) revised the exchange rate management policy that modifies the exchange rate formula applied to implement the exchange rate policy pegging the SBD to an invoice-weighted basket of currencies. The aim was to (1) ensure that daily management of the exchange rate follows the basket peg more closely to achieve a constant and stable exchange rate; (2) ensure that the currency peg does not lead to real exchange rate misalignment (overvaluation, etc.) in the presence of inflation differentials with the Solomon Islandsʹ trading partners; and (3) review the merits of widening the current band of ±1% to ±1.5% around the base parity of the bilateral (SBD– U.S. dollar) exchange rate in order to benefit more fully from the advantages of a basket peg. Effective May 27, 2014, the SBD per U.S. dollar value is the value of the index multiplied by the SBD per U.S. dollar value on the day the basket peg was introduced. The exchange rate (midrate) is now expressed in SBDs per U.S. dollar and is determined by the total index of the basket multiplied by the initial base rate expressed in SBDs rather than U.S. dollars, as was done previously. The midrate is announced as the official rate. Technical difficulties in implementing the basket peg regime were resolved in the second half of 2014 and, effective October 30, 2014, the ±1% band around the base rate was removed after the October 29, 2014, CBSI board meeting. As a result, the SBD now follows the basket peg more closely."
2014,726,Somalia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The currency of Somalia is the Somali shilling (SOS). However, the de facto currency is the U.S. dollar. Dollar banknotes are used as cash currency with Somali banknotes serving as a subdenomination. Neighboring country currencies are used in border areas. Mobile phone payments, with transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, are widely used. Most transactions are settled in U.S. dollars. The shilling exchange rate has remained broadly stable in recent years at So. Sh. 20,000 per U.S. dollar. During May 2015, the rate depreciated briefly to So. Sh. 23,500 per U.S. dollar in response to an influx of new, counterfeit notes. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is undetermined. Due to the absence of administrative measures controlling the level of the exchange rate and the inoperative status of the CBS in the foreign exchange market, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a free-floating arrangement."
2014,199,South Africa,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free-floating. The exchange rate of the rand is determined by demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has a publicly announced foreign exchange policy of purchasing foreign currency in the local foreign exchange market from time to time, when market conditions permit, with the aim of accumulating foreign exchange reserves without seeking to influence theexchange rate. The SARB interacts with Authorized Dealers (ADs) as the price taker for official and commercial purposes. The market makers and brokers quote prices to other market participants; the SARB does not quote prices for market participants. The SARB does not publish information on its interventions (only monthly releases of the official gold and foreign exchange reserves). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2014,733,South Sudan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime of South Sudan is a conventional peg, described as a fixed exchange rate regime in the Bank of South Sudan Act (BSS Act). South Sudan introduced its currency (South Sudanese pound, SSP) on independence in July 2011. The BSS Act mandates that the currency be allowed to float for the first six months to find its market value and thereafter be fixed. In early September 2011, the BSS fixed the exchange rate at SSP 2.95 per U.S. dollar and began rationing foreign exchange. As a result, a parallel market developed in which the exchange rate is at a premium compared with the official rate. The foreign exchange market is at a nascent stage, and the BSS plans to implement measures to unify the official and parallel market rates."
2014,184,Spain,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Spain participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17 as of January 1, 2014) of the EU and has no separate legal tender.

When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2014,524,Sri Lanka,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating since its introduction by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on January 23, 2001. The CBSL intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the exchange rate. Since October 1, 2013, the Sri Lanka rupee has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. While the exchange rate appears to have started a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar beginning in mid-October 2014, further observation is necessary to determine the new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as stabilized. The CBSL publishes intervention data on its website and in its annual report."
2014,361,St. Kitts and Nevis,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Kitts and Nevis participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2014,362,St. Lucia,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Lucia participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement at EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2014,364,St. Vincent and the Grenadines,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Vincent and the Grenadines participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement at EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2014,732,Sudan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating. The exchange rate is determined in the interbank market, in which participants deal directly with each other. The CBOS participates in the market through swaps under a rules-based mechanism that triggers intervention if the exchange rate exceeds a band of ±4% around the previous dayʹs closing rate. The main objective of the policy is exchange rate stability. Sudanʹs multiple exchange rate regime includes (1) a central rate of SDG 5.68 per U.S. dollar that also applies to fuel imports, payment of government obligations, and customs valuation; (2) a gold exchange rate used by the CBOS for gold transactions; and (3) an MFR used mainly by commercial banks and exchange bureaus. The MFR applies to all other transactions and has two components: (1) an indicative rate; and (2) a flexibility factor that allows banks to deviate from the average of the indicative rate and the incentive by a range of ±4%. The rate for collecting customs revenue changes daily. During the first six months of 2014, the official exchange rate was kept fixed at SDG 5.71 per U.S. dollar, but it followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band beginning in July 2014. Given the focus of the CBOS on exchange rate stability and in line with the fluctuation of the curb market exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The CBOS does not disclose information on its interventions to the public."
2014,366,Suriname,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. In accordance with a July 1994 presidential decree, the exchange rate is determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange. The exchange rate of the Surinamese dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official market remained stable until January 20, 2011, when the authorities devalued the currency by 20%, to SRD 3.30 per U.S. dollar, and set a band of SRD 3.25–3.35 per U.S. dollar, within which all official and commercial market transactions may take place. However, the Surinamese dollar–U.S. dollar exchange rate remained stabilized within a narrower band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. In the event of a persistent discrepancy between the official rate and the rates quoted by commercial banks and nonbank institutions, the official exchange rate is adjusted to reflect prevailing market conditions."
2014,734,Swaziland,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The Central Bank of Swaziland Order of 1974 is the legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement.
2014,144,Sweden,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the krona is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are allowed under extraordinary circumstances (e.g. participation in concerted interventions with other CBs). Sveriges Riksbank (SR) announces its intervention in a press communiqué, explains the motive, and discloses the framework of intervention. However, no intervention has been reported since June 14, 2001."
2014,146,Switzerland,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market. However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free-market rates. On September 6, 2011, the SNB set a minimum exchange rate floor of CHF 1.20 per euro to contain deflationary risks and stop a sharp appreciation of the franc and is committed to maintaining the limit by buying unlimited foreign currency. As a result, initially the Swiss franc was classified as other managed arrangement due to its limited volatility based on the role of official action. The Swiss franc has followed an appreciating trend within a 2% band against the euro since May 31, 2013. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. Effective January 15, 2015, the SNB decided to discontinue the minimum exchange rate floor of CHF 1.20 per euro. Although the Swiss franc has departed from the 2% band against the euro since mid-January 2015, further observation is necessary to determine the new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate remains classified as a crawl-like arrangement. Purchases of foreign currencies in support of the minimum rate toward the end of 2014 amounted to CHF 25.8 billion. The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual accountability report."
2014,463,Syria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Following the political crisis, a parallel foreign exchange market emerged in early April 2011, diverging from the official rate by about 15%. The rate in the parallel market moved erratically, reaching LS 105 per U.S. dollar in March 2012. During this time, the CBS gradually adjusted the official rate toward convergence with the market rate. On March 10, 2012, the CBS announced that it would trade foreign currency with money dealers at rates other than the official rate published in its daily bulletin. This new price list, called the “intervention list,” is much closer to market prices and has helped ease pressure on the market and bring the market rate closer to the official rate. By December 31, 2012, the official and parallel rates had come under additional pressure, and the two rates diverged by 28%, with the official rate reaching LS 71 per U.S. dollar and the parallel rate widening to LS 91 per U.S. dollar. As of December 5, 2014 (date of latest available data on the parallel rate for 2014), both the official and parallel exchange rates had increased substantially: the parallel rate reached LS 198 per U.S. dollar while the official rate stood at LS 174, narrowing the divergence between the two rates to about 14%. Given the developments in the official rate, the emergence of the parallel market, and the intervention rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2014,923,Tajikistan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, with no predetermined path. The exchange rate of the somoni is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, in which the National Bank of Tajikistan (NBT) may intervene to limit exchange rate volatility. The NBT provides information on the volume of its purchase and sale transactions in foreign exchange on a daily basis. In 2014, the exchange rate remained stabilized until April, and started a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a 2% band in May, with one realignment in December 2014. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate was reclassified to crawl-like from a stabilized arrangement, effective May 1, 2014. The rate of depreciation from May to December 2014 was about 9%. While the somoni depreciated more rapidly beginning at the end of March 2015, further observations are necessary to determine the new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate remains classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2014,738,Tanzania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. In recent years, the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) has participated in the interbank foreign exchange market mostly on the selling side. The policy intention of selling U.S. dollars has been to sterilize liquidity generated by government spending of aid funds. BOT foreign exchange sales have varied depending on the liquidity in the economy and the amount and effectiveness of other monetary policy instruments. The BOT informs the market of the target sale of foreign exchange in two months. Trading in the interbank foreign exchange market is conducted using the Reuters trading platform in a two-way quote system. The BOT is not required to indicate two-way quotes when it participates in the interbank market. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2014,578,Thailand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. Under the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the value of the baht is allowed to be determined by market forces, reflecting demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. However, the Bank of Thailand (BOT) reserves the right to curb excessive volatility in the value of the baht that is not aligned with economic fundamentals."
2014,313,The Bahamas,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The Bahamian dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at par.
2014,648,The Gambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Gambia participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the dalasi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15% of the central rate; however, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures. The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange to augment international reserves and ensure market orderliness. During 2013, the dalasi depreciated against the U.S. dollar following a series of presidential exchange rate directives that imposed overvalued exchange rates. Because there were no further presidential interventions and in the absence of similar constraints on the exchange rate formation in 2014, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from other managed to a floating arrangement, effective January 1, 2014. The CBG does not publish intervention data."
2014,537,Timor-Leste,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely.
2014,742,Togo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Togo participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2014,866,Tonga,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. The external value of the paʹanga is determined on the basis of a weighted currency basket comprising the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and Fijian dollar. The basket weights are determined based on the proportions of trade with trading partners. The weights are not published. The exchange rate of the paʹanga in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) within a band of ±5%. The NRBT does not publish intervention data. Under Section 34 of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act, the external value of the paʹanga is determined from time to time in a manner approved by the NRBT board, after consultation with the minister of finance and national planning, in view of Tongaʹs obligations connected with international monetary agreements in which it takes part. Section 35(1) of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act empowers the NRBT to set the exchange rate."
2014,369,Trinidad and Tobago,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Given the stability of the Trinidad and Tobago dollar against the U.S. dollar, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) routinely issues press releases on its direct intervention in the foreign exchange market."
2014,744,Tunisia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, as indicated on the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) website. On April 18, 2012, a fixing arrangement (i.e. the average of market participantsʹ quotes) replaced the currency composite as the reference exchange rate published by the BCT. The BCT intervenes in the foreign exchange market in the event of a high level of demand that exceeds the capacity of banksʹ foreign exchange positions. Previously, the BCT intervened to keep the exchange rate stable vis-à-vis a currency composite using its own rates in response to requests from banks for quotes. The rates quoted by the BCT were based on the currency composite and updated continuously to reflect the exchange rates prevailing in the international foreign exchange markets. During the transition to the new operational framework, since September 2011, the BCT has made several adjustments to the level of the exchange rates in the basket. Since March 2014, the dinar has followed a depreciating trend vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BCT posts the volume of transactions between authorized intermediaries and the volume of its daily interventions in the interbank foreign exchange market on its website."
2014,186,Turkey,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lira is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) announced the general framework of the monetary and exchange rate policies envisaged for 2015 in a presentation titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2015” on December 10, 2014. The CBRT may intervene directly or through flexible auctions in the market in both directions, in case of unhealthy price formation due to speculative behavior stemming from a loss of market depth. In that case, the CBRT may buy or sell foreign exchange at the rates quoted by the banks directly. The results of the CBRTʹs daily auctions and volume of its interventions are published on its website. The CBRT introduced the reserve option mechanism (ROM) as a new monetary policy tool. In this framework, the CBRT allows banks to hold a fraction of their mandatory reserves for lira liabilities in foreign currency and gold. The CBRT may increase or decrease the reserve option coefficients (ROCs), the amount of foreign currency or gold required to meet one unit of Turkish lira required reserve. Typically, the ROC is an increasing function of different tranches of lira required reserves; the tranches of the mechanism and the corresponding levels of ROC are determined by the CBRT. The ROM has been used as an active policy tool by the CBRT and has contributed to stabilization of capital flow volatility, indirectly influencing exchange rate movement. Given the CBRTʹs policy focus on limiting exchange rate volatility through the ROM, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2014,925,Turkmenistan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT) is responsible for exchange rate policy implementation. The Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan (CMT) takes ultimate responsibility for economic policy decisions.
2014,869,Tuvalu,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Tuvalu is the Australian dollar, which circulates freely."
2014,746,Uganda,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The authorities intervene in Ugandaʹs foreign exchange market when short-term fluctuations jeopardize its orderly operation. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market at the banksʹ quoted rates using the best bid-ask principle. The BOU publishes information on its interventions in its monthly, quarterly, and annual reports, including amounts purchased and sold through the reserve buildup program, interventions, and targeted transactions."
2014,926,Ukraine,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. In January 2014, the market exchange rate began depreciating, despite NBU interventions. On February 7, 2014, the NBU decided to discontinue massive interventions in support of the hryvnia and let its official hryvnia–U.S. dollar exchange rate adjust to the market rate. In response to the balance-of-payments crisis in 2014–15, and with a view to avoiding large and balance-sheet-damaging exchange rate overshooting, the NBU introduced administrative measures on foreign exchange operations (including capital flow measures). Several of these measures give rise to exchange restrictions. The official exchange rate is calculated based on the weighted average rate for the foreign exchange transactions of the previous day. The NBU publishes monthly information about its foreign exchange market interventions on its website."
2014,466,United Arab Emirates,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The dirham was pegged to the U.S. dollar in 1980. A January 2003 decision made the peg official. The United Arab Emirates Central Bank (UAECB) does not publish its intervention data.
2014,112,United Kingdom,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating. The exchange rate of the pound sterling is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of England (BOE) has a separate pool of foreign exchange reserves, which it uses at its discretion to intervene in support of its monetary policy objectives. A monthly press release issued by Her Majestyʹs Treasury (HMT) reports HMT and BOE intervention. There were no foreign exchange interventions during 2014."
2014,111,United States,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating; the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are not formally ruled out in the United States, but they are rarely used. The secretary of the treasury is responsible for the formulation and implementation of international monetary and financial policy, including foreign exchange market intervention policy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has separate legal authority to engage in foreign exchange operations, which are conducted in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury to ensure consistency with U.S. international monetary and financial policy. The Treasury and the Fed have closely coordinated their foreign exchange operations since early 1962, when the Fed commenced such operations at the request of the Treasury. Operations are conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as fiscal agent of the United States and as the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. Interventions are announced when they occur and the size of the interventions is reported in the Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations quarterly bulletin. U.S. authorities last intervened in the foreign exchange market in March 2011, following the earthquake in Japan, in a coordinated G7 effort to sell Japanese yen. The United States did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2014."
2014,298,Uruguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the peso is determined on the basis of supply and demand, although the CBU reserves the right to intervene to cushion abrupt changes in a concentrated market of few transactions. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The CBU publishes information on intervention on its website."
2014,927,Uzbekistan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of the supply of and demand for foreign exchange (Article 15 of Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 556-II on Foreign Exchange Regulation of December 11, 2003). The sum–U.S. dollar exchange rate is used as an operational benchmark, since 95% of the countryʹs trading operations are carried out in U.S. dollars. With the aim of preventing sharp movements in the exchange rate and supporting the exchange rate level that is in line with targeted macroeconomic indicators and monetary policy, the CBU participates in currency trading, acting as a buyer and seller of U.S. dollars and euros. Given that the sum has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2014,846,Vanuatu,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Since 1988, Vanuatu has officially maintained an adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement. Currently, the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a transaction-weighted (trade and tourism receipts) basket of currencies whose weights and composition are not publicly disclosed and are adjusted periodically. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed, because the composite weights are not disclosed and cannot be confirmed, and, in practice, the vatu has been slightly more volatile against a composite than the 2% band typical of stabilized or pegged arrangements."
2014,299,Venezuela,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg, with the official exchange rate of the CENCOEX (previously CADIVI) pegged to the U.S. dollar. Nevertheless, there are two additional exchange rates, one resulting from the operations performed at special auctions of foreign currency or securities denominated in foreign currency conducted through the SICAD, which at the end of 2014 was equal to Bs 12.00 per U.S. dollar, and the other as a result of operations performed through the Alternative Foreign Currency Exchange System (SICAD II). Effective March 24, 2014, the SICAD II had been in operation every banking business day; this system had been used for the performance of foreign currency purchase and sale operations, with an average exchange rate of Bs 50.34 per U.S. dollar, which remained stable around this value throughout the year (with a standard deviation of approximately Bs 0.7 per U.S. dollar). Effective February 13, 2015, the SICAD II system was replaced by a new exchange rate platform—the Marginal Foreign Currency Exchange System (Sistema Marginal de Divisas, SIMADI)—which expanded participation in foreign exchange transactions to individuals and legal entities operating in any economic sector and having accounts in financial institutions stipulated in Exchange Agreement (Convenio Cambiario) No. 20. Foreign exchange transactions via the new platform may take place in cash and by transfers and are supervised by Sudeban and the central bank. At inception, foreign exchange transactions took place at the exchange rate Bs 170 per U.S. dollar, and since then local currency has depreciated by about 18% to Bs 200 per U.S. dollar. The share of foreign exchange transactions at the SIMADI rate is relatively small (about 4.3% of total foreign exchange supply)."
2014,582,Vietnam,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Effective September 5, 2014, Clause 2, Article 15 Decree No. 70/2014/ ND-CP of July 17, 2014, clarifies: (1) The official exchange rate is determined based on demand and supply in the foreign exchange market under State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) regulations. The SBV regulates the exchange rate by deploying monetary policy instruments and intervening in the foreign exchange market. (2) The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, and is determined by the SBV based on a currency basket of countries with trade, financing, and investment relationships with Vietnam consistent with macroeconomic targets of each period. In 2014, the dong remained stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. While it appears that the exchange rate departed from the 2% band from mid-March 2015, further observations are necessary to determine the new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2014,474,Yemen,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been free floating since July 1996. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) receives most of the foreign exchange proceeds, particularly crude oil export revenues, official loans, and official development assistance. The official exchange rate was steady at about Yrls 213.80 per U.S. dollar throughout 2011 and the first half of 2012, after which it hovered around Yrls 214.89 per U.S. dollar until 2014. The dollar exchange rate in the parallel market was Yrls 228.00 per U.S. dollar at the end of 2011. It gradually converged with the official rate by mid-2012, which led to the unification of the exchange rates. Given the unification of the official and parallel market rates and stability of the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar since June 2012, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2014,754,Zambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The official exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) intervenes primarily through transactions with ADs, which are all registered commercial banks. BOZ interventions are published as historical data, and its foreign exchange transactions are published in the biweekly statistics."
2014,698,Zimbabwe,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The Zimbabwean dollar is no longer used as the domestic currency for economic, financial, and administrative purposes as of February 2009. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender."
2015,512,Afghanistan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market through twice-weekly selling auctions. The results are published on the DAB website. The DAB deals with ADs only through the auction. The primary goal of these auctions is to regulate the growth of reserve money and/or currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction exchange rate volatility. The Afghani depreciated against the U.S dollar by around 14.9% in 2015. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2015,914,Albania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lek is based on supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) is not usually active in this market. In accordance with its regulations, intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) calming a disorderly market, which arises due to seasonality and lack of market depth. Interbank market bid-ask spreads, total market turnover, and speed of one-way moves are taken into consideration when intervening to calm a disorderly market. Excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market is considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementation of Monetary Policy, which seeks to avoid intervening in the market. Foreign exchange market liquidity has improved over time, and the last time the BOA intervened to calm a disorderly market was in the first half of 2009; (2) considerable exchange rate misalignment with fundamentals: The lek is considered misaligned with fundamentals if there is lengthy overshooting of the exchange rate; and (3) in accordance with the monetary policy document, revised in January 2015, which requires the authorities to accumulate foreign reserves to cover at least four months of imports in the medium-term as well as the countryʹs short-term external debt. When the BOA intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market, its counterparties are the commercial banks; if necessary, it may carry out its intervention with foreign exchange bureaus. The BOA intervenes through (1) verbal intervention, in the form of press releases in the print or electronic media and/or press conferences; and (2) transactional intervention. The latter can take two forms, direct intervention and intervention, via preannounced auctions. In the case of direct intervention, the exchange rate is determined by commercial banksʹ quotes and the BOA Monetary Operations Departmentʹs quotes. When the intervention exchange rate is uniform for all counterparties, the BOA publishes that rate on its Reuters page and simultaneously communicates the rate to commercial banks that do not participate in the Reuters system and to foreign exchange bureaus with which it has contact. When different exchange rates are used, the BOA announces only the fact that it has intervened; it publishes with a three-month lag the amount of the intervention in a quarterly bulletin that summarizes its foreign exchange operations with banks and the public sector. The regulation regarding foreign exchange interventions includes the option to carry out transactional interventions via auctions announced in advance. The BOA announces the date, amount, and currency it wants to buy at least one month before the auction, and the banks submit one bid each (in an amount equal to the limit it has provided the BOA). The BOA decides how much to buy based on the rates offered and its target amount. Following the auction, the BOA publishes the amount offered by commercial banks, the amount accepted by the BOA, the range of offered bids, the range of accepted bids, and the prorate at the maximum accepted bid. The exchange rate remained stable in 2015. The current account deficit narrowed in 2015 and was mostly financed by higher FDI. Interventions by BOA and MOF in the foreign exchange market accounted for about 0.3% of the total volume in this market in 2015 (versus 0.6% in 2014). The MOF did not hold any foreign exchange buying auction in 2015 and has not published a calendar for 2016. It is not expected to do so as it has sufficient funds in foreign currency to meet its foreign debt obligations for the current year. The BOA published a calendar for foreign exchange purchasing auctions in November 2014, which was later amended in May 2015 to include two more purchasing auctions in August and November, in addition to the ones held in April and July. Swaps with the central government constitute an indirect intervention channel. The BOA aims to avoid disruptions from large and irregular demand of foreign exchange by MOF. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2015,612,Algeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Bank of Algeria (BA) does not announce the path of the exchange rate. The external value of the dinar is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the BA is the main seller because of significant inflows related to commodity exports, including hydrocarbons, which, under current law, must be surrendered to the BA. The BA manages the dinar with reference to a basket of currencies, and the rate of the dinar relative to the currencies in the basket is based on balance of payments data. The BA has not set a target range for fluctuation of the dinar outside or within any particular band, and the observed exchange rate movements do not confirm any constant weights of the currency composite. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BA does not disclose information about its interventions."
2015,614,Angola,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; however, the BNA intervenes in the foreign exchange market through auctions and direct sales. The BNA receives foreign currency from taxes paid by oil companies to the government, and it also buys foreign exchange from oil companies that in turn pay their resident suppliers in local currency. The BNA then sells the foreign currency to the market (through auctions or direct sales), with special focus on priority imports and sectors. The BNA monitors exchange rate fluctuations to maintain price stability in the economy given the still high pass-through of the exchange rate to prices. In 2015, the kwanza depreciated by 34% with limited volatility and several periods of divergence during the second half of the year. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed, from a crawl-like arrangement, effective June 5, 2015. The BNA publishes the auction results and respective reference rates at the BNAʹs website."
2015,311,Antigua and Barbuda,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Antigua and Barbuda participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2015,213,Argentina,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, and the exchange rate of the peso, which is determined in the MULC by supply and demand, applies to all transactions in foreign exchange and foreign currency banknotes. According to the BCRA December 2015 report “Targets and programs for the development of monetary, exchange rate, financial and credit policies for 2016”, the Central Bank (CB) has adopted a floating exchange rate regime, which provides some flexibility to face shocks caused by adverse international contexts, retaining the possibility of preventing, through monetary instruments, an excessive nominal economic volatility. As of mid-December 2015, the exchange rate arrangement followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Following the relaxation of foreign exchange controls on December 17, 2015, the peso initially depreciated by about 40%, followed by about 5% depreciation in the period between December 18, 2015, and February 1, 2016, with little intervention by the CB in the spot market. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a crawl-like arrangement, effective December 17, 2015."
2015,911,Armenia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Central Bank of Armenia (CBA) intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility, defined as short-term, high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by speculative or trend-following elements rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. Since November 2014, the dram increased its volatility and departed from the 2% band against the U.S. dollar. The depreciation rate was around 16% from November 2014 to January 2015. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a crawl-like arrangement, effective November 4, 2014. The CBA intervenes anonymously mainly via auctions of foreign exchange, or openly in the interbank market, or through the stock exchange. The CBA publishes weekly intervention data on its website every Monday."
2015,314,Aruba,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The legal documents that established the fixed exchange rate arrangement are AB 1992 No. GT 6 State Decree for Fixing Parity of the Aruban Florin and Notice on Foreign Exchange Transactions 90/A2.
2015,193,Australia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"Both the de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as free floating. However, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) retains discretionary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market and has done so during periods of significant market disorder and/or gross misalignment of the exchange rate. Given the high level of development of the Australian foreign exchange market, interventions have been rare. The most recent period of intervention was in 2007–08 and was in response to episodes of significant market disorder—that is, instances when market functioning was impaired to such a degree that it was clear that the observed volatility was excessive. The RBA may also vary the way intervention is conducted; it may enter the interbank foreign exchange market directly through voice or electronic brokerage platforms or use an agent bank. As a matter of government policy, most wholesale purchases of foreign currency by government agencies are made through the RBA. The RBA manages the flows from purchases on behalf of the government so as to minimize their market impact—e.g., by executing these trades when the market is liquid and, if necessary, breaking up the required purchases into a series of smaller transactions. Monthly purchases and sales of foreign exchange are published on the RBA website. Daily data on foreign exchange market interventions are published on the RBA website annually, following the release of the RBA Annual Report."
2015,122,Austria,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Austria participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2015,912,Azerbaijan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Effective December 21, 2015, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) announced a change of the de jure exchange rate arrangement to managed floating from other managed. The CBA stands ready to intervene to smooth out excess volatility and influences the market exchange rate by intervening in the foreign exchange market to maintain the official rate within a prescribed corridor of ± 2%. Effective February 16, 2015, the CBA implemented an exchange rate policy based on the currency basket comprising the U.S. dollar and the euro. Previously a bilateral peg against the U.S. dollar had been in place since January 2011. On February 21, 2015, the CBA devalued the currency by 25% relative to the U.S. dollar, and on December 21, 2015, by 32%. Since then, as a result of official action, the manat has been allowed to gradually depreciate based upon supply and demand factors vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from a stabilized arrangement, effective December 21, 2015. The CBA publishes its foreign exchange intervention data quarterly."
2015,419,Bahrain,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rate is published in the Official Gazette of the CBB.
2015,513,Bangladesh,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Bangladesh Bank (BB) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to contain undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Since November 2013 the taka has been kept broadly stable against the U.S. dollar, fluctuating well within a 2% band. Based on this, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been classified as a stabilized arrangement. The BB publishes information on its interventions in its periodic publications (e.g., Annual Report)."
2015,316,Barbados,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The minister of finance, after consultation with the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), pegged the Barbados dollar to the U.S. dollar on July 5, 1975, pursuant to the Exchange Control Act and the Central Bank of Barbados Act. Intervention data are published in Economic and Financial Statistics Section H, Table 2."
2015,913,Belarus,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating. Effective January 9, 2015, the NBRB switched to a more flexible exchange rate policy that provides for minimizing currency interventions in the medium term. To that end, in practice use is made of an operating rule developed on the basis of IMF recommendations and limiting the possibility of NBRB influence on determination of the exchange rate. Currency interventions are used to reduce the daily volatility of the exchange rate against a basket of currencies (the U.S. dollar, euro, and Russian ruble), and not for regulating its level. As a result of the Belarusian rubel tracking a composite, because the exchange rate is not closely enough to be classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from a crawl-like arrangement, effective January 9, 2015. The National Bank does not publish data on its interventions."
2015,124,Belgium,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating.

2015,638,Benin,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Benin participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2015,514,Bhutan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. No current legal documents establish a fixed exchange rate arrangement; the ngultrum has been pegged at par to the Indian rupee since the introduction of the ngultrum in 1974. Under the Royal Monetary Authority Act of Bhutan 2010 (Provisions 88 and 89), the Bhutanese government, on recommendation of the RMA, may declare the external value of the ngultrum, and the RMA will determine the appropriate external value. The RMA does not publish the intervention data."
2015,218,Bolivia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling peg to the U.S. dollar (also called a “sliding” rate officially) and is characterized by small movements that are not announced in advance. The Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) determines the floor price on the daily competitive foreign exchange auction (bolsín) in which the financial system participates. The CBB ensures that the rate is consistent with moderate inflation, thus mitigating external and internal inflation pressure, since the exchange rate is still used as a benchmark for the price of nontradable goods, albeit to a decreasing extent due to dedollarization in real and financial transactions. Within the scope of the official crawling peg exchange rate regime, in an external environment characterized by marked exchange rate volatility and decreasing external inflation, the sliding rate was set at zero to prevent misalignment of the real exchange rate with its long-term trend. Because the boliviano stabilized anew against the U.S. dollar since November 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The authorities consider that the de facto stabilized arrangement does not fully characterize the CBBʹs exchange rate administration because the official policy of a crawling peg has not changed. The CBBʹs crawling peg mechanism allows the sliding rate to be set to zero without any regime change if the underlying economic fundamentals warrant it. The CBB publishes data on its exchange market interventions and foreign exchange purchases and sales in the “Weekly Statistics” section of its website."
2015,963,Bosnia and Herzegovina,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The CB covers base money with its foreign reserves, including currency in circulation and commercial bank deposits. The Law on the Central Bank, adopted by the parliamentary assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, guarantees convertibility of the currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are no restrictions on the purchase and sale of foreign exchange. The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) publishes data on its sales and purchases."
2015,616,Botswana,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as a crawling peg. The official exchange rate of the pula is determined according to a weighted basket of currencies comprising the SDR and the South African rand. The crawl rate is set as the difference between the Bank of Botswanaʹs (BOBʹs) inflation objective and the inflation forecast in major trading partner countries. The crawl rate is thus determined using a forward-looking approach and is revised regularly. In this approach, the authorities periodically determine the crawl rate for the subsequent period, such as the next 6 or 12 months. Effective January 26, 2015, the weights of the basket changed to 50% for the South African rand and 50% for the SDR (in 2014, 55% and 45%, respectively), and the rate of change was set to zero—previously 0.16%, effective January 04, 2016, the rate of change was set to 0.38%—previously zero."
2015,223,Brazil,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. There is no official exchange rate for Brazil as the exchange rate of the real is defined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Brazil (CBB) intervenes to smooth out excessive volatility. Intervention data are available in the CBBʹs weekly publication on currency flows on the CBB website.
2015,516,Brunei Darussalam,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD) issues Brunei dollars and manages the Currency Fund, which is used to back up the currency in circulation. Under the Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA), signed in 1967, which remains in effect between the AMBD and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the monetary authorities agree to the mutual exchange of their currency at par without charge. Government authorities and banks must accept each otherʹs currency at par, and the currencies are customary tender in both countries. Excess currency is repatriated regularly, with the cost borne by the currency-issuing authority. The AMBD must ensure that reserves in the Currency Fund cover at least 100% of the currency in circulation as required under the Currency and Monetary (Amendment) Order, 2010. The AMBD publishes data on the reserves used to cover the currency in circulation in its annual report."
2015,918,Bulgaria,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board, which was introduced by the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) of June 1997. The lev was fixed initially to the German mark and subsequently to the euro. The 1997 law was a conceptually new legal act, introducing the currency board mechanism, and cannot be considered an amendment to the previous law of the same name, which was in effect until 1997 and repealed by the new law. Aggregate data for daily euro–lev turnover between the BNB and local banks are published on Reuters page NBOB3. Yearly aggregates are available in the annual report."
2015,748,Burkina Faso,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Burkina Faso participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2015,618,Burundi,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The new regulations governing the interbank foreign exchange market allow the BRB to intervene on its own initiative. The Burundi franc has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since March 2013. In 2015, the BRB managed the official exchange rate closely, despite the fall in the official foreign reserves of around 57%. However, the parallel market exchange rate of the Burundi franc deviated significantly from the official exchange rate with a spread of 23% as of end-December 2015. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2015,624,Cabo Verde,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The MOFs and CBs of Portugal and Cabo Verde have the authority to change the exchange rate arrangement.
2015,522,Cambodia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. Given the high degree of financial dollarization, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to accommodate demand for riel and maintain exchange rate stability. Since March 2015, the riel has increased its volatility, while still being managed. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed from a stabilized arrangement, effective March 11, 2015. Detailed intervention data are available on request."

2015,156,Canada,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, with the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar determined by supply and demand. However, under an intervention policy established by the government in close consultation with the Bank of Canada (BOC), the BOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market on behalf of the government. The current policy is to intervene on a discretionary, rather than systematic, basis and only in exceptional circumstances. The last time the BOC intervened was as part of the concerted intervention with authorities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Europe, and Japan to counter an excessively strong yen following the March 2011 earthquake in Japan. Earlier, the BOC intervened in September 1998 to influence movements in the Canadian dollar. Interventions are announced on the BOCʹs website, and the amount of intervention is published in the governmentʹs monthly official press release on international reserves."

2015,228,Chile,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate of the peso currently in effect is freely determined in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Chile (BCCH) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market, in exceptional circumstances, to keep the currency near its equilibrium value in order to avoid costly future reversals. These interventions take the form of transparent, well-founded measures, including explicit definitions of the periods and amounts involved and clearly explained reasons for the intervention. The BCCH usually announces the amount of foreign exchange it intends to buy or sell in its monthly bulletin. It publishes its auction results daily and its reserves weekly. The BCCH has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since 2011."
2015,924,China,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"China officially maintains a de jure managed floating exchange rate arrangement with a view to keeping the RMB exchange rate stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies to preserve the stability of the Chinese economy and financial markets. The floating band of the RMBʹs trading prices is 2% against the U.S. dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market—i.e., on each business day, the trading prices of the RMB against the U.S. dollar in the market may fluctuate within a band of ±2% around the midrate released that day by Chinaʹs Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS). The Peopleʹs Bank of China (PBC) announced that the RMBʹs floating range would be expanded in an orderly manner, based on the developments of the foreign exchange market and economic and financial situation. Within the trading band, banks may determine their RMB exchange rates to the U.S. dollar with their clients without any limit on the spread, based on market supply and demand (PBC No. 2014/188). Effective August 11, 2015, the PBC decided to further increase the flexibility of the RMB-to-USD exchange rate midrate quoting mechanism, thereby enhancing the market determination of RMB exchange rates, and giving market supply and demand an even greater role in exchange rate formation. In 2015, the RMB exchange rate depreciated around 4.5% against the U.S. dollar, influenced by the higher forecast US Federal Reserve interest rate increases, the strengthening U.S. dollar, downward pressures on the Chinese economy, adjustments by corporations to their balance sheets, and other such factors. Because the RMB has been relatively stable against the U.S. dollar in the period from End-December 2014 to August 2015, intervention continues, and the foreign exchange market remains heavily regulated, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to other managed from a crawl-like arrangement, effective December 24, 2014. The PBC does not publish its intervention data."
2015,233,Colombia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. All foreign exchange transactions are conducted at a market-determined exchange rate; however, the Bank of the Republic (Banco de la República—BR) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to (1) maintain an adequate level of international reserves in order to reduce the vulnerability of the economy to external shocks; (2) smooth excessive appreciations and depreciations that threaten the success of future inflation targets and economic activity, and (3) limit excessive volatility of the short-term exchange rate in order to avoid erratic financial market behavior. The BR can intervene in the foreign exchange market through the following operations: (1) auction purchases or sales of foreign exchange at market rates; (2) auction sales of put or call options at market rates; and (3) effective July 1, 2015, spot sales of foreign exchange under FX swap contracts, at the rates set by the BR, through auction or OTC mechanisms (R.E. 6 of May 22, 2015 of the BR Board of Directors. The foreign exchange-swaps foreign exchange intervention mechanism was approved. External Resolution 4 of 2008 was repealed.) The BRʹs interventions are based on the guidelines established by its board of directors. The daily and monthly results of the BRʹs intervention in the foreign exchange market and information regarding each auction are available on its website. Effective October 30, 2015, the BR reintroduced auctions for US$500 million in call options, to be triggered only when the spot exchange rate (Colombian Peso (COP)/U.S. dollar (USD)) depreciates by more than 7% from its moving 20-day average against the U.S. dollar. Effective December 23, 2015, the BR decided to change the percentage for triggering an options auction to 5%, in view of liquidity conditions in the foreign exchange market. Finally, effective February 19, 2016, the BR further reduced the rate triggering an options auction to 3% in order to mitigate the impact of overreaction of the exchange rate on inflation expectations and to help preserve liquidity conditions in the foreign exchange market. However, the mechanism was triggered for the first time on May 20, 2016 and was later eliminated Effective May 27, 2016 as the central bankʹs concerns regarding liquidity in the foreign exchange market diminished. The exchange rate performance was significantly affected by the weakening of the Colombian peso between January 2015 and April 2016, mainly because of the trend in oil prices as well as concerns about the impact of that decline on the fiscal and current account deficits. In addition, international factors, such as Chinaʹs weakening economy, improvement in the economic performance of the United States, and uncertainty about when U.S. monetary policy would return to normal, also affected the exchange rate performance. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement."
2015,632,Comoros,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The Comoros participates in the franc zone area. The Comorian franc is pegged to the euro at the fixed rate of CF 491.96775 per euro; the value of other currencies is based on this fixed rate and on the exchange rates of these currencies in the foreign exchange markets. The exchange rate arrangement is established by the following documents: (1) the monetary November 23, 1979, cooperation agreement between the Comorian and French governments; (2) the November 23, 1998, decision by the European Council of Ministers authorizing France to maintain its monetary arrangements with the CFA area countries and the Comoros; and (3) the January 14, 1999, order of the governor of the Central Bank of Comoros (CBC) on euro–Comorian franc parity. Decree No. 87-005/PR, Regulating Financial Relations between the Comoros and Other Countries and its regulations apply. The government of either the Comoros or France may change the exchange rate arrangement after notification to the other party."
2015,238,Costa Rica,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Effective February 2, 2015, under Article 5 of the legal act adopted during session 5677-2015 of the Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCRʹs) board of directors held January 30, 2015, a de jure managed float exchange arrangement was established (previously classified as a crawling band arrangement). Under this arrangement: (1) the BCCR will allow the exchange rate to be freely determined by foreign currency supply and demand, but it may participate in the market in order to meet its own foreign currency requirements and those of the nonbank public sector (NBPS) and, at its discretion, to prevent sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate; (2) the BCCR may carry out direct operations or use foreign currency trading instruments that it deems appropriate, in accordance with current regulations; and (3) in its stabilization transactions in the foreign currency market (Monex), the BCCR will continue to apply intervention rules updated to reflect the amendments established under this resolution. In 2015, the balance of private sector foreign exchange transactions showed a surplus of US$2.682 million, that is US$985 million more than the excess demand for foreign exchange in 2014. This higher surplus was largely as a result of the improvement in the terms of trade (5.3%), associated with lower international commodity prices, in particular oil prices, which dropped by almost 40%. In that context, the CB carried out foreign exchange transactions to smooth undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, for operations of the nonbank public sector, and to reinforce the country's financial shield. The aim of these operations was not to reverse the exchange rate trend, which should respond to changes in fundamentals; it is, however, recognized that in the absence of such intervention nominal appreciation of the domestic currency would have been higher. Below is a description of the nature of the participation broken down by grounds for participation: For stabilization purposes, the CB sold foreign currency at the beginning and end of 2015, up to a cumulative total of US$139 million. At end-2014, the balance of the budget for meeting the foreign currency needs of the NBPS (Article 10 of the Minutes of Meeting 5651-2014 of June 25, 2014) was US$359.2 million, while at end-2015 it stood at US$269.4 million. Pursuant to the foreign currency purchasing programs agreed by the board of directors of the CB, US$721.3 million was acquired in 2015. As a result of the above, in 2015, the colón saw a nominal appreciation of 0.8%, with reference to the average exchange rate for the U.S. dollar on the foreign currency market (MONEX). The coefficient of variation and the standard deviation of the exchange rate were, in that order, 0.32% and C 1.70 (2.5% and C 13.5 in 2014). At the end of the first quarter of 2016, the exchange rate in MONEX was C 538.04, with the colón showing a slight depreciation of 0.1% compared to end-2015. The BCCR carried out sales amounting to US$12.6 million in response to volatility and, in net terms, surrendered US$105.0 million to the NBPS to meet its foreign currency needs. Because the CB maintains significant role in active exchange rate management to avert excessive volatility in light of the large financial dollarization of the financial system, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as stabilized."

2015,960,Croatia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating without a predetermined path. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) may set intervention exchange rates, which it applies in transactions with banks to limit exchange rate volatility. The CNB conducts foreign exchange auctions on a discretionary basis to ensure the stability of the kuna and provide liquidity for payments domestically and abroad (described under Section H.1.a.3. Auction). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. Intervention data (prices and volume) are published on the CNB website."
2015,354,Curaçao and Sint Maarten,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. Official buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are set daily on the basis of rates of the U.S. dollar abroad. The current peg was established in a national decree on December 24, 1971."
2015,423,Cyprus,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Cyprus participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2015,935,Czech Republic,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The external value of the koruna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) participates. With inflation below target and continued undershooting expected, the CNB announced November 7, 2013, that it would (if needed) intervene in the foreign exchange market to weaken the koruna to bring its exchange rate against the euro close to CZK 27. Since then, the koruna traded between CZK 27.0 and CZK 28.33, and stabilized within a 2% band against the euro, with a temporary shift in January 2015. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Data on CNBʹs foreign exchange operations are published on the central bankʹs web page."
2015,636,Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Congo franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The BCC, while observing the international reserves target in its monetary program, intervenes to smooth daily fluctuations in the market exchange rate if they exceed ±1.5%. The BCC intervenes through an auction, which is the only operational framework for the BCCʹs transactions with the market. The BCC has intervened on both sides of the market. The franc stabilized against the U.S. dollar beginning in early January 2012. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2015,128,Denmark,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The formal framework for the Danish fixed exchange rate policy is the ERM II. Denmark participates in the ERM II with a central rate of DKr 746.038 per €100. The central rate is a conversion of the central rate vis-à-vis the deutsche mark before the third stage of the EMU and was last adjusted in January 1987. Denmark has entered into an agreement with the ECB and the euro area member countries on a narrower fluctuation band of ±2.25%. In recent years, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) has consistently maintained a stable krone within less than 1% of the central rate. The DNʹs net purchase or sale of foreign currency during a month is published at 4:00 p.m. on the second working day of the following month in the Foreign Exchange and Liquidity press release. The agreement on Denmarkʹs fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro within a narrow fluctuation band of ±2.25% around the central rate in ERM II was concluded at an informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council of September 25–27, 1998, in Vienna, between the ministers of economy and finance and the CB governors of the EU member countries."
2015,611,Djibouti,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"Djiboutiʹs monetary system is based on a currency board. The Djibouti franc has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1949, but the legislation establishing the currency board and determining the fixed exchange rate is Law No. 118/AN/11/6ème L of January 22, 2011. The Central Bank of Djibouti (BCD) guarantees and provides for unlimited conversion to U.S. dollars of banknotes and coins used as legal tender in Djibouti. The full issuance of Djibouti francs is covered by foreign exchange reserves. The National Assembly of Djibouti has the authority to make decisions regarding changes in the exchange rate arrangement."
2015,321,Dominica,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Dominica participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2015,243,Dominican Republic,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) aims to increase gradually the flexibility of the exchange rate alongside the implementation of the inflation-targeting framework formally adopted in 2012. The CBDR does not pursue a particular fixed exchange rate level, but rather seeks to manage a pathway around its long-term equilibrium value, consistent with the fundamentals of the Dominican Republic economy and its inflation target. The CBDR intervenes in the foreign exchange market to avoid instances of excessive exchange rate volatility that might affect the inflation target given that the exchange rate pass-through remains high. Since February 2010, the peso has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBDR publishes data on foreign exchange sales and purchases in the foreign exchange market by different institutional actors (financial intermediaries and remittance/foreign exchange agents). The data are published on a gross (all transactions) basis and a net basis (excluding interbank operations). The CBDR does not disclose data on its volume of foreign exchange transactions with financial intermediaries."
2015,248,Ecuador,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Ecuador is the U.S. dollar, which circulates freely. All monetary and financial transactions and operations, and their attendant accounting records, carried out in Ecuador must be denominated in U.S. dollars, in conformance with Article 43 of the Organic Monetary and Financial Code. The circulation, exchange, withdrawal, and destruction of U.S. dollars, legal tender in Ecuador, are the exclusive domain of the CBE, in accordance with the provisions of this code and the regulation issued by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulatory Board. The CBE is required to satisfy demand for liquidity in Ecuador in a timely manner so as to ensure the normal course of economic transactions. To that end, it is authorized to make necessary remittances, which are not deemed imports or exports. Such transactions carried out by the CBE are exempt from all taxes. Effective February 27, 2015, pursuant to Resolution No. 005-2014-M, electronic currency is placed in circulation exclusively by the CBE, backed by its liquid assets, based on policies and regulations issued by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulatory Board. The CBE is the only entity authorized to provide and manage national or electronic metallic currency in Ecuador equivalent and convertible to U.S. dollars, in accordance with the provisions of this code and the regulation and authorization of the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulatory Board. The currency referred to is a means of payment and is unrestricted legal tender with unlimited redeemability in Ecuador within the framework of the regulations issued by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulatory Board. The government may not require a private individual or legal entity to accept any currency other than the U.S. dollar."
2015,469,Egypt,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The interbank system was launched on December 23, 2004. This system created depth and liquidity in the market by bringing buyers and sellers together on one transparent platform. According to the interbank convention, banks exchange foreign currency with each other; hence, the official exchange rate is determined through the interaction of supply and demand in the market. In late 2012, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) introduced the multiple price foreign exchange auction mechanism through which the CBE can inject into or drain foreign currency from the domestic market. Currently, the official market comprises both the interbank market and the foreign exchange auction mechanism. The official exchange rate is calculated as the weighted average of the interbank market and CBE auction results. In 2015, the Egyptian pound depreciated around 9.5% with short periods of stability and more than one realignment in a six-month period. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from a stabilized arrangement, effective January 19, 2015. The CBE does not publish intervention data. The CBE has been limiting exchange rate flexibility since January 2015 and allocating foreign exchange according to a priority list. The interbank market has been inactive. This situation has resulted in backlogs of foreign exchange demand."

On January 1, 2001, the U.S. dollar became unrestricted legal tender with unlimited redeemability for the settlement of debt in El Salvador. The U.S. dollar is used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange. The Central Reserve Bank (CRB) must exchange colones in circulation for U.S. dollars at banksʹ request at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per U.S. dollar."

2015,643,Eritrea,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. Directive No. 1/2005 on the Unified Exchange Rate is the legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement.
2015,939,Estonia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Estonia participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2015,644,Ethiopia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The birr followed a depreciating trend vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar with two one-time devaluations in 2010. Given the pattern of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The NBE publishes the exchange rates and the amount traded in the interbank market."
2015,819,Fiji,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) does not publish intervention data. The power to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is provided in the Reserve Bank of Fiji Act. A change in the exchange rate arrangement may be proposed by the RBF and approved by the minister for finance.

2015,962,Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Under the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Article 33), the denar exchange rate is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. This arrangement is still in place under the current legislation. However, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) participates in the foreign exchange market (Article 34), in order to achieve the goals determined with the monetary and the foreign exchange policies. The NBRM is implementing the monetary strategy of targeting the nominal exchange rate against the euro, the intermediary objective of the monetary policy being the maintenance of the denar exchange rate stability. Thus, the NBRM maintains a stable exchange rate within a narrow fluctuation band of bid-ask exchange rates determined by the Committee for Operational Monetary Policy. Size and direction of the interventions are published on a regular quarterly basis, in the Quarterly Report of the NBRM (Balance of Payments section, Financial Account subsection, in the part commenting on the developments of the foreign exchange reserves). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."

2015,646,Gabon,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. Gabon participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the CEMAC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (Joint Monetary Committee) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to amend the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2015,915,Georgia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Georgia is floating. The National Bank of Georgia (NBG) intervenes in the foreign exchange market through foreign exchange auctions, but does not make any explicit or implicit commitment with respect to an exchange rate target or path. Foreign exchange sales have been used to limit excessive foreign exchange volatility in the context of significant adverse exogenous shocks. Developments at both the global and regional level led to a significant reduction in external revenues. During 2015, in line with the slowdown and currency depreciations in Georgiaʹs main trading partners, exports fell by more than 11%. A sharper cutback was observed in money transfers (25% y-o-y). The resulting shortfall in foreign earnings, combined with the worldwide strengthening of the U.S. dollar, has caused the Georgian lari to depreciate. The NBG sold US$287 million in foreign exchange in 2015, US$60 million in January 2016 and bought US$15 million in March 2016. The lari depreciated by about 27% against the U.S. dollar in 2015 and subsequently appreciated about 4% as of end-March 2016. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. The amount sold at the NBGʹs foreign exchange auctions and the average exchange rates are posted on the NBG website shortly after each auction."

2015,652,Ghana,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the cedi is determined in the market by both interbank foreign exchange activity and foreign exchange bureaus. Ghana joined the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the cedi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within a margin of ±15% around the central rate. However, the authorities have yet to implement these measures. The BOG does not publish information on its interventions. In 2015, the Ghanaian cedi weakened against the U.S. dollar in the first quarter of the year as a result of demand pressures amid inadequate foreign exchange supply on the market. The Ghanaian cedi depreciated cumulatively by about 36% at the end of the second quarter (From GH?3.2/US$ to GH?4.36/US$). However, it recovered during the last two quarters at GH?3.7950/US$. The cumulative depreciation during 2015 was about 18%."

2015,328,Grenada,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Grenada participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2015,258,Guatemala,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. In accordance with the Monetary Law and the Free Foreign Exchange Convertibility Law, Guatemala has a flexible exchange rate arrangement under which the rate is determined in the foreign exchange market by supply and demand. However, the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the nominal exchange rate, without affecting its trend. The BOG intervenes through foreign exchange auctions based on a transparent rule, which limits daily volatility. Effective January 1, 2016, the fluctuation margin (added to or subtracted from the five-day moving average of the exchange rate) used to determine whether the BOG may intervene in the foreign exchange market was increased to 0.75% (up from the previous margin of 0.70%). The BOG may also intervene whenever the nominal exchange rate shows unusual volatility. In 2015, the quetzal was relatively stable, with maximum and minimum values of 7.59133 and 7.77216 quetzals to the U.S. dollar, consistent with domestic exchange rate conditions such as seasonality and foreign exchange outflows. Because the volume of BOG participation in the foreign exchange market has been around 1.0% of total foreign exchange traded since 2013, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to floating from a crawl-like arrangement, effective November 16, 2012. Intervention data are available on the BOGʹs website."
2015,656,Guinea,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Guinea announced its participation in the exchange rate mechanisms (ERM and ERM II) of the WAMZ, which formally limits the fluctuation of the franc to ±15% around a central rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, but this has yet to be implemented. During 2015, the CBRG intervened once a week through a competitive foreign exchange auction market with commercial banks. However, a structural excess demand of foreign exchange is not reflected in the exchange rate set during the weekly auctions. In practice, the system was a foreign exchange allocation. Commercial banksʹ transactions with their customers were capped within a band of ±4% around the most recent weekly auction rate. Because the franc has increased its volatility since February 2015, while still being managed, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from a stabilized arrangement, effective February 5, 2015. The CBRG regularly publishes information regarding foreign exchange market interventions. Effective January 4, 2016, the CBRG replaced the previous weekly foreign exchange allocation with a bi-weekly competitive auction, reflecting market demand for foreign currency. The CBRG adopted an intervention policy based on a budget of foreign exchange sales, and banks were allowed to negotiate freely foreign exchange sales and purchases with their clients. Previously, weekly fluctuation of the reference rate was capped at ±4% of the weekly auction rate."
2015,654,Guinea-Bissau,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Guinea-Bissau participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2015,336,Guyana,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; the exchange rate of the Guyanese dollar is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Guyana (BOG) periodically purchases foreign currency from foreign exchange dealers in order to maintain international reserves at acceptable levels. In accordance with bilateral agreements with the CARICOM CBs, the BOG quotes weekly rates for certain CARICOM currencies. Reflecting the stability of the Guyanese dollar against the U.S. dollar as a result of interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2015,263,Haiti,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to avoid excessive volatility. Following an increased depreciation in June and July 2015, the gourde appreciated around 9% until end-August and then resumed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed from a crawl-like arrangement, effective June 29, 2015.The BRH publishes information on foreign exchange interventions weekly on its website."
2015,268,Honduras,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling band. The exchange rate of the lempira is determined by foreign exchange auctions of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). The BCH maintains an operational band requiring all bid prices for the purchase of foreign exchange to be within a range of 7% above or below the base price, with the requirement that bids in auction not exceed 1% of the average base price of the auctions of the preceding seven business days (Resolution No. 271-7/2013 of the BCH). The base price is calculated weekly according to a procedure established by the BCH board of directors for this purpose, which includes the following variables: (1) the differential between the domestic inflation rate and the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners, (2) changes in the exchange rates of these countriesʹ currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and (3) the performance of official reserve assets. The external inflation rate is considered to be the weighted average of the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners. Domestic inflation is measured by the consumer price index. The change in the U.S. dollar exchange rates of the main trading partners is measured using the effective exchange rate index, which is compiled weekly based on the weighted average of the main trading partnersʹ exchange rates expressed in units of their respective currencies to US$1.00. Finally, an adjustment factor is applied to the base price of the auction, depending on the number of months of imports covered by the BCHʹs reserve assets. In July 2011, the BCH (through Resolution No. 284-7/2011 of July 21, 2011) reactivated the crawling band system that had been in operation until mid-2005. As a result, following a long period of stability, the lempira was allowed to crawl once again in July 2011 and thereafter followed a steadily depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar, with a small one-time adjustment in November 2011. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling peg arrangement. The BCH publishes its sales of foreign exchange on its website daily."
2015,532,Hong Kong SAR,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires that the monetary base be backed at least 100% by and that changes in it be matched 100% by corresponding changes in the reserve currency (U.S. dollar) at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75–HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—has been in place since May 18, 2005. The monetary base includes issued notes and coins, the balance at the HKMA of banksʹ clearing accounts (i.e., the aggregate balance), and outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Consistent with currency board principles, the HKMA may issue additional Exchange Fund paper when there is an inflow of funds, and the program may expand along with the interest payments on such paper. Issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which back banknotes issued by note-issuing banks (NIBs), must be made against U.S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. Issuance and withdrawal of government-issued notes and coins are settled against U.S. dollars at the same fixed rate. The legal documents that establish the currency board include the Basic Law (Chapter V, Section 1, Articles 110 and 111); the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66); and an exchange of letters between the financial secretary and the Monetary Authority specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system under the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The letters specify that the financial secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system, including the linked exchange rate. Section 3(1) of the ordinance, as amended, specifies that the Exchange Fund “shall be under the control of the Financial Secretary and shall be used primarily for such purposes as the financial secretary thinks fit affecting, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong SAR and for other purposes incidental thereto.” The HKMA is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments, and operational means for doing so, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary system. The HKMA makes immediate announcements of the impact on the aggregate balance due to purchases or sales of U.S. dollars by the Currency Board via various information vendors, including Reuters and Bloomberg. The information is also available on the HKMA website."
2015,944,Hungary,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating because of discretionary intervention by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) in the foreign exchange market. The possible objectives of foreign exchange intervention are listed in the MNBʹs intervention strategy, which has not been published. The strategy aims to avoid disruptive market fluctuations and exchange rate overshooting. However, the strategy emphasizes that the MNB generally refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange market. The MNB converts foreign currency for the government and net current and capital transfers from the EU at market rates. These transactions change the foreign exchange reserve position of the MNB. If the resulting reserve dynamics are not in line with the MNBʹs reserve management objectives, some of the funds are channeled to the market. Transactions are small and conducted at market prices. The MNB announced the policy of channeling the foreign-exchange position resulting from EU transfers several times in the past, most recently in March 2009 for that year. Until 2009, the net amounts were published quarterly in the MNBʹs quarterly and annual reports. The MNB no longer publishes intervention data."
2015,176,Iceland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. In 2015, the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) continued to follow the strategy of increased foreign exchange market intervention as set forth by the Monetary Policy Committee in May 2013. CBI transactions accounted for about 55% of total market turnover, up from 43% in 2014, and the total turnover increased by around 80% year over year. The objective of the intervention strategy is to mitigate short-term exchange rate volatility and expand the CBIʹs nonborrowed reserves inasmuch as conditions allow. Exchange rate volatility diminished significantly after the strategy was announced. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. The CBI publishes monthly data on its interventions in the foreign exchange market."
2015,534,India,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is largely market determined, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market to manage excessive volatility and maintain orderly conditions without any fixed target or band for the exchange rate. The RBI publishes monthly data on its interventions (foreign exchange purchases and sales) in its monthly bulletin with a six-week lag."
2015,536,Indonesia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating (adopted August 14, 1997). The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Bank Indonesia (BI), however, may intervene—as part of a policy mix—whenever necessary to achieve the inflation target and to maintain macroeconomic stability. When it intervenes, the BI does not target a specific rate or maintain exchange rate movements within a specific band; rather it provides liquidity to maintain market stability. The BI does not disclose data on its interventions. Since August 2013, the rupiah has moved more freely. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement."
2015,433,Iraq,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements have been retroactively reclassified to a conventional peg arrangement, effective January 15, 2012 (previously classified as de jure floating and de facto stabilized). The Central Bank Law gives the Board of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) the authority to formulate exchange rate policy, and the board has maintained its policy to keep the official exchange rate at ID 1,180/82 (bid-ask) per U.S. dollar since December 1, 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, the CBI set the cash and transfer exchange rate at ID 1,182 + 8 (fees) = 1,190 per U.S. dollar. The CBI provides foreign exchange at the official exchange rate plus commissions for permissible transactions through its daily auctions (allocations), establishing a peg. However, because certain transactions are excluded from access to the CBI auctions, many transactions take place at parallel market exchange rates. The CBI publishes the daily volume of the auction allocation on its website."
2015,178,Ireland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Ireland participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2015,429,Islamic Republic of Iran,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a managed floating arrangement against a basket of currencies since 2002. From September 2012 to July 2013, the rial traded at three different rates—an official appreciated rate for imports of priority goods, a second official rate for the sale of oil export receipts and imports of other essential goods, and a flexible bureau rate for the sale of non-oil exports and imports of all remaining goods. The authorities unified the two official exchange rates at the more depreciated rate in July 2013, after the premium between the depreciated official and bureau rates remained about 30%. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2015,436,Israel,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the Bank of Israel (BOI) announced in August 2009 that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market in the event of unusual movements in the exchange rate that are inconsistent with underlying economic conditions or when conditions in the foreign exchange market are disorderly. The BOI did not intervene in the foreign exchange market from August 2011 through March 2013. In April 2013, the BOI intervened again in the foreign exchange market in line with the foreign exchange policy announced in August 2009. In May 2013, the BOI announced a multiyear foreign exchange purchase plan to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate. The BOI purchased US$8.77 billion in the foreign exchange market during 2015 (US$7 billion in 2014), of which US$3.1 billion (US$3.5 billion in 2014) was part of the purchase plan to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate and the rest was under the foreign exchange policy announced in August 2009. The BOI announced, on November 19, 2015, that it will purchase US$1.8 billion in 2016 in the foreign exchange market to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate. The BOI does not publish daily purchase information. Since May 2013 the BOI has intervened more than three times in a six-month period, so the new shekelʹs de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement."

Italy participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2015,343,Jamaica,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market, in which the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) intervenes occasionally with sales and purchases of foreign currency. The Jamaican Dollar has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2% since 2011. Given the pattern of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BOJ publishes information on its interventions in its Annual Report and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report."
2015,158,Japan,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the yen is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disorderly conditions in the market. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Interventions fall within the mandate of the MOF, which publishes daily purchases and sales amounts as well as intervention currencies on its website. The Bank of Japan (BOJ), acting as agent of the minister of finance, intervenes in the market through financial institutions and/or brokers. The last time the MOF intervened in the foreign exchange market was from October 31 through November 4, 2011 (¥9,091.6 billion) to address excess volatility and disorderly exchange rate movement. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating."
2015,439,Jordan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dinar is officially pegged to the SDR, but in practice, it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since late 1995. The CBJ is responsible for maintaining the stability of the dinar exchange rate."
2015,916,Kazakhstan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Effective August 20, 2015, the National Bank and the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan announced the transition to a de jure free floating exchange rate arrangement for the tenge. From the beginning of the year through July 14, 2015, the National Bank adhered to a currency band arrangement that was set at 185 +3/?15 tenge to the U.S. dollar. During this period the exchange rate of the tenge fluctuated between 182.85 and 186.80 tenge to the U.S. dollar. On July 15, 2015, with the aim of continuing a more flexible exchange rate policy within the context of the transition to an inflation-targeting framework, and taking into consideration the fact that the tenge exchange rate had reached the upper border of the band, the band was expanded and was set at 185 +13/?15 tenge. The exchange rate of the tenge fluctuated between 187.05 and 188.35 tenge to the U.S. dollar. On August 21, 2015, the exchange rate of the tenge against the U.S. dollar weakened significantly, from 188.35 to 255.26 tenge. Subsequently, given active speculative transactions by participants in the foreign exchange market, the exchange rate of the tenge weakened further to 284.28 tenge to the U.S. dollar. Effective November 5, 2015, with the aim of preserving gold and foreign exchange reserves, the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) adopted a decision to minimize its participation in the foreign exchange market. During the given period, the exchange rate of the tenge fluctuated between 298.92 and 349.12 tenge to the U.S. dollar. At the end of December, the rate in exchange trading was 340.01 tenge to the U.S. dollar, which represents a decline in value by 13.75% during this period (the price of oil fell by 22.3%, from US$47.98 to US$37.28 a barrel). Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified twice within the AREAER reporting period (1) from stabilized to other managed, effective August 20, 2015, and (2) from other managed to a floating arrangement, effective December 15, 2015."
2015,664,Kenya,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. Official foreign exchange market interventions aim to moderate the rate of change and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than to establish a particular level. Data on interventions are only partially disclosed. If the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) uses the auction system to intervene, the market is informed of the amount dealt and the average rate. (The average rate is published after the auction closes.) If the CBK chooses to intervene directly (i.e., by buying or selling foreign exchange from or to banks directly through the Reuters Dealing System), the market is informed but amounts and rates are not published. During April–September 2015, similar to other currencies in Sub-Saharan Africa (SSA), Kenyan shilling came under pressure and depreciated over 10% while the CBK intervened to mitigate excessive volatility in the foreign exchange markets. Since October 2015, the shilling has experienced relative stability following the normalization of market conditions with frequent CBK intervention on both sides of the market."
2015,826,Kiribati,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. There is no central monetary institution, and the authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange. The Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Bank (Kiribati) Limited, the only commercial bank, quotes daily rates for 15 currencies on the basis of their respective rates against the Australian dollar."
2015,542,Korea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the won is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. As such, the system is managed in accordance with the principles defined by the free floating system, and the governmentʹs role is very limited to remain within the range allowed by the free floating system. However, because of the lack of information on the authoritiesʹ interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Korea (BOK) may intervene in the market with the funds of the BOK and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund when it is deemed necessary for the stability of the market. Interventions in the spot market or through derivatives in the forward market are not announced, and intervention data are not published."

2015,443,Kuwait,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. According to the law of the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK), the exchange rate arrangement is specified by an “amiri” decree in consultation with the governor of the CBK (see CBK Law, Chapter I, Article II). The arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. Intervention data are not disclosed to the public."
2015,917,Kyrgyz Republic,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The NBKR participates in the interbank foreign exchange market and makes interventions as needed to smooth out exchange rate fluctuations. During 2015, the som depreciated around 28% against the U.S. dollar, and appreciated around 8% during the first quarter of 2016. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The NBKR publishes information on its website about its daily purchases and sales of foreign exchange."
2015,544,Lao P.D.R.,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange arrangement is a managed float. Since January 2015 the kip has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to stabilized from a crawl-like arrangement, effective January 22, 2015."
2015,941,Latvia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Latvia participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2015,446,Lebanon,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is free floating. In practice, the exchange rate remains within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (LL 1,501–1,515/U.S. dollar). Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Banque du Liban (BDL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market daily from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and from 10:00 a.m. until noon on Friday. The BDL does not publish intervention data."

2015,668,Liberia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to counter speculative movements. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement since November 2011, when the exchange rate departed from the stabilized band, showing increased but limited flexibility while still being managed. The foreign exchange auction data (volume, price, etc.) are published on the CBL website."
2015,672,Libya,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the SDR. Since March 2014, the dinar followed an appreciating trend within a 2% band against the SDR and stabilized anew from January 2015. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a conventional peg from a crawl-like arrangement, effective January 27, 2015."
2015,946,Lithuania,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Effective January 1, 2015, Lithuania participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers. Thus, effective January 1, 2015, following the adoption of the euro the de facto exchange rate arrangement of Lithuania has been reclassified to the category free floating from the category currency board. Previously, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was a currency board. The currency board was established by the Law on Credibility of the Litas and was in effect since April 1, 1994. The litas exchange rate against the euro was fixed by the Resolution of the Government of the Republic of Lithuania approving the proposal of the Bank of Lithuania (BOL) regarding the anchor currency and the litas official exchange rate (February 1, 2002, No. 157) and the Resolution of the Bank of Lithuania on the Anchor Currency and the Official Exchange Rate of the Litas (February 1, 2002, No. 15)."

2015,674,Madagascar,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the official interbank market. The Central Bank of Madagascar (CBM) intervenes in the interbank market to smooth large exchange rate fluctuations and meet foreign reserve targets. Information on CBM daily interventions is not publicly available. Only the weighted average daily rate and the number and amount of transactions are made available to the public through the CBM official site. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. In 2015 the central bank (CB) undertook buyback operations in the foreign exchange market, which artificially maintained the official exchange rate at a higher level than the market exchange rate. In March 2015, the CB reduced the scope of the buyback transactions and the official rate depreciated by 10% against the U.S. dollar. In early September 2015, the CB discontinued the buyback operations. At the time, the buyback operations had created a wedge between the official published exchange rate and the market exchange rate of over 10%. The wedge disappeared following the end of the buyback operations as the official rate depreciated to converge with the market rate. The ariary appreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar over the last two months of 2015, even though a further 7% depreciation had occurred between the end of buyback operations and end-December. The CB has not reintroduced these operations."
2015,676,Malawi,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Official intervention focuses on building foreign reserves and limiting exchange rate volatility while taking into account seasonal fluctuations. In May 2012, the Reserve Bank of Malawi (RBM) devalued the kwacha from MK 168 to MK 250 per U.S. dollar. In anticipation of this devaluation, the RBM took steps aimed at allowing market forces to determine the exchange rate and at improved availability of foreign exchange in the market. Since May 2012, the RBM has not set a target rate and allowed substantial exchange rate volatility. The exchange rate stability from April to September 2014 can be attributed to excess supply of foreign exchange during the tobacco marketing season and the deliberate policy of the RBM to buy excess dollars over and above private sector demand offered by AD banks throughout the period. Once the tobacco marketing season ended, the exchange rate depreciated 24% from mid-September to November 2014, appreciated afterward about 11% as of February 2015, and depreciated by 52% from March 1 to end-2015. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2015,548,Malaysia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) operates a de jure managed float for the ringgit with reference to a currency basket. The composition of the basket is not disclosed. Because the ringgit tracks a composite, although not closely enough to be classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BNM does not publish its intervention data. The BNM also does business directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers at rates it deems fit for maintaining orderly market conditions without targeting any particular level of the exchange rate. The ringgit exhibited significant volatility during 2015 and depreciated against the U.S. dollar by over 18% and by 14% in nominal effective terms."
2015,556,Maldives,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Since 2011, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. This regime allows the rufiyaa to float within a 20% band around a central parity of Rf 12.85 per U.S. dollar. However, the rufiyaa remained stabilized in a narrow band against the U.S. dollar near the ceiling of the band (Rf 15.42 per U.S. dollar). Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Under the Maldives Monetary Authority Act, the president may decide to change the exchange rate arrangement and adjust the exchange rate."
2015,678,Mali,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Mali participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."

2015,682,Mauritania,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The ouguiya was previously de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar, at an exchange rate of UM 268.6 per U.S. dollar (October 24, 2005, through January 25, 2007). Since 2007, the new foreign exchange market uses a fixing system in which the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) intervenes. The BCM intervenes in order to regulate the exchange market according to its exchange rate policy objectives (smoothing the exchange rate and the projected level of official reserves). Since September 2014, the ouguiya has followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified from a stabilized to a crawl-like arrangement, effective September 9, 2014. A summary statement of market turnover data is updated daily on the BCM website."
2015,684,Mauritius,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand forces in the domestic foreign exchange market. Interventions by the BOM in the foreign exchange market are limited to smoothing volatility and do not aim to offset market forces. Information regarding interventions is published regularly on the BOM website and in its publications.
2015,273,Mexico,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating; the exchange rate of the peso is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Foreign Exchange Commission (FEC), comprised of members of the CB and the MOF, determines the foreign exchange rate policy. In the past, Mexico implemented rule-based mechanisms to provide liquidity and promote the sound functioning of the foreign exchange market, as well as to cope with market volatility. The FEC does not target or defend any exchange rate level. These mechanisms were designed to work as an assurance to market participants, and the daily amount used was limited compared to the volume traded of the Mexican Peso in the market. Since the end of 2014, the FEC announced different mechanisms to maintain the orderly functioning of the local foreign exchange market. On December 8, 2014, the FEC announced that Banco de Mexico (BM) would auction up to US$200 million daily at a minimum exchange rate equivalent to the reference exchange rate (FIX) of the preceding business day in accordance with BM provisions, plus 1.5%. Thus, the auction resulted in allotments only if the exchange rate depreciated at least 1.5% between banking days. Effective July 31, 2015, the trigger for additional auction was reduced to a daily depreciation of 1% from the previous 1.5%.1%. On November 23, 2015, an additional auction of another US$200 million was triggered by a depreciation of 1.5%. Between March 11, 2015 and November 20, 2015, there were also unconditional regular auctions, initially of US$52 and from July 31, 2015 onwards US$200 million a day. Effective February 17, 2016, the FEC announced that they would immediately stop all rule-based and regular auctions, and instead rely on discretionary intervention only under extraordinary and unusual circumstances. However, this has occurred only once as of April 30, 2016. Because the BM has intervened in the foreign exchange market more than three times in a six-month period since end-May 2015, but met the criteria of a free floating arrangement anew since end-November 2015, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified twice within the AREAER reporting period (1) to floating from a free floating exchange rate arrangement, effective May 20, 2015, and (2) to free floating from floating, effective November 20, 2015. All past auction results are publicly available."

2015,921,Moldova,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Moldova (NBM) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the leu against the U.S. dollar. Sharp fluctuations are not specifically defined; however, the NBM intervenes based on market conditions and future expectations of market participants. These interventions do not aim to change the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM intervenes directly at the market-quoted rates and publishes aggregated monthly data on its website regarding its interventions and interbank market turnover. The data show interventions by currency and type of operation (spot or derivative)."
2015,948,Mongolia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The BOM reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market.

Since April 2001, the basket has been composed of the euro and the U.S. dollar, with weights of 60% and 40%, respectively, as of April 2015. The Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) publishes its monthly foreign exchange purchases and sales on its website. Authority to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is found in Dahir No. 1-05-38 of November 23, 2005, promulgating Law No. 76-03 establishing the charter of the BAM (Chapter II, Missions, Section I, Core missions, Article 8). The exchange arrangement falls within the purview and prerogatives of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The BAM is responsible for its operational implementation (quoted rates, ranges) and any changes and monitors the foreign exchange market."
2015,688,Mozambique,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Both the de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. As a major conduit for foreign aid flows, the Bank of Mozambique (BM) is the main channel for foreign exchange into the market. It also intervenes to smooth seasonal fluctuations. For its transactions in Mozambiqueʹs interbank foreign exchange market (MCI) the BM uses the quotes shown on the screen for each commercial bank. The BM is therefore a price taker—i.e., it takes the highest foreign exchange selling rate and the lowest buying rate. The BM publishes information on its website regarding foreign exchange transactions in the MCI. It also publishes the schedule of MCI benchmark average exchange rates in the Jornal Notícias and on its website."
2015,518,Myanmar,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. In April 2012, the CBM started daily two-way multiple price foreign currency auctions, which provide a mechanism for the market to determine an exchange rate the CBM can use to set its new reference rate. However, the CBM reserves the right to intervene periodically to mitigate undue exchange rate volatility and support the liquidity of the kyat in the foreign exchange market. The CBM has no predetermined target for the level of the kyat exchange rate or its trading range and expects the value to fluctuate with supply and demand in the market. The CBM has widened the trading band in the wholesale market from ±0.3% to ±0.8% of the CBM reference rate. Beginning in October 2014, the CBM attempted to slow kyat depreciation by setting its reference rate at a more appreciated rate than the parallel market rate, which increased the spread between the two rates significantly. In mid-May 2015, the CBM intervened again to slow kyat depreciation by adjusting its reference rate to avoid redundant daily volatility. Starting this period, the spread between the reference rate and market rate had widened due to the rapid depreciation of the market rate by 8.5%. Effective July 13, 2015, the CBM set its reference rate to align with the parallel market rate. It remained within 2% until March 31, 2016."
2015,728,Namibia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement is the CMA agreement.

When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2015,196,New Zealand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may intervene if the exchange rate is exceptionally high or low, if that rate is not justified by economic fundamentals, and if there is a material prospect that the intervention will influence the exchange rate. Interventions may not be used as an attempt to influence the long-term trend of the exchange rate. The RBNZ publishes information on its foreign currency assets and liabilities, including its foreign currency intervention capacity (stock of reserves available for intervention) and foreign exchange swap position, on its website but does not publish data on its direct intervention. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The exchange rate has trended broadly lower since January 2015, in line with falling commodity prices, declining inflationary pressures and downward revisions to the expected path for monetary policy rates."
2015,278,Nicaragua,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) publishes aggregated monthly data pertaining to BCN foreign exchange transactions with the banks and the government.

2015,694,Nigeria,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed arrangement. The CBN explicitly aims to maintain an exchange rate principally driven by market forces but intervenes to reduce volatility and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. The CBN supplies foreign exchange to the IFEM at a rate of N197 per U.S. dollar. IFEM participants are required to pass on this foreign exchange to their clients at a rate of no more than N199.5. Because the naira has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since March 2015, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from other managed arrangement, effective March 9, 2015. The CBN publishes information on the amount of foreign exchange it supplies to the IFEM on its website while the banks are required to publish the utilization in the national newspapers. Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires maintaining the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar within ±15% of the central rate, but the CBN has not implemented this regime."
2015,142,Norway,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as free floating; the krone floats freely and independently against other currencies. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Norges Bank (NB) does not normally intervene to influence the exchange rate of the krone; however, it may intervene in the foreign exchange market on short notice if the krone deviates substantially from the level the NB considers reasonable in relation to fundamentals and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target. The NB may also intervene in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level. The NB has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999. Foreign exchange purchases or sales for the Government Pension Fund Global are publicly preannounced on the CB website. In extraordinary circumstances, the NB may provide foreign exchange liquidity via collateralized operations. This was done between September 2008 and July 2009."
2015,449,Oman,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg to the U.S. dollar. According to the Banking Law of 1974, later amended by Royal Decree No. 114/2000, the par value of the rial is determined from time to time by His Majesty The Sultan."
2015,564,Pakistan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) does not explicitly or implicitly commit to an exchange rate target or path. Market intervention has generally been directed toward building foreign exchange reserves and ensuring smooth functioning of the foreign exchange market. Due to limited volatility, with periods of divergence, the de facto exchange rate is classified as other managed arrangement. The SBP does not publish information on its intervention."

The exchange rate of the kina is determined in the interbank market, in which ADs participate. The Bank of Papua New Guinea (BPNG) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to smooth extreme fluctuations; however, it does not publish information on its interventions. Since April 2014, the exchange rate has followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. On June 4, 2014, the BPNG introduced an exchange rate trading band with a kina buying rate within 75 basis points above the interbank midrate and a kina selling rate within 75 basis points below the midrate."
2015,288,Paraguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand. The objective of the Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) under Article 3 of Law No. 489/95 is to preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the CBP aims to smooth seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. The CBP intervenes occasionally in the market to smooth the effects of undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. The CBP, as the governmentʹs financial agent, receives U.S. dollars from the government by way of royalties and compensation paid by the binational hydroelectric entities and exchanges them for guaraníes at the request of the government for the purpose of public expenditures. These dollars from the public sector are returned to the market through programmed sales. Accordingly, in July 2013, the CBP implemented a program of preannounced sales of the U.S. dollars it purchases from the government. The new program is more transparent, better communicated, and more consistent with an inflation-targeting framework. This program indicates in advance the nature, frequency, and size of the CBPʹs foreign exchange transactions to avoid influencing market expectations of the exchange rate. Every action of the CBP in the exchange market is announced in advance. Data on CBP operations in the market, whether in the form of programmed or supplementary foreign exchange transactions, are updated weekly on the CBPʹs website."
2015,293,Peru,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Peru has a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) is authorized by law to intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility without altering the exchange rate trend. BCRP interventions can also be conducted through dollar-indexed bonds, foreign exchange swaps, and repos. During 2015, the BCRP intervened in the spot and forward markets, which led to a fall in net international reserves (NIR) from US$62.3 billion to US$61.5 billion (32% of GDP) at the end of 2015. Spot intervention continued through early 2016, with a further loss in NIR of US$1.3 billion until February. During March 2016, NIR increased by 0.9 billion. Amid intervention, the sol depreciated by 14.6% in 2015 (year over year in nominal terms) (less than the currencies of trading partners and competitors, but more than the inflation differential with the U.S.). During March, the sol appreciated 5.9%. Foreign exchange intervention amounted to US$8.1 billion in the spot market and US$3.3 billion in other instruments in 2015. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The BCRP publishes daily information about its intervention operations (prices and amounts) on its website."

The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) adheres to a market-determined exchange rate policy with some scope for occasional action solely to prevent potentially disruptive sharp fluctuations. The BSP does not target or support a given level of exchange rate; it allows the value of the peso to be determined by supply and demand. The BSP may participate in the U.S. dollar–peso market directly with market participants or via market makers and does not disclose intervention data, which are for internal use only. Data on currency swaps settled in foreign currency and non-deliverable forwards settled in domestic currency are reported monthly in Sections II and IV, respectively, of the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which is posted on the BSP website. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."

Narodowy Bank Polski (NBP), however, may intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary to ensure domestic macroeconomic and financial stability, which is conducive to meeting the inflation target in the medium term. NBP does not disclose its intervention data. Given that NBP intervened in the foreign exchange market last time in 2013 (the only intervention in that year), the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. The NBP did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2015. In addition, the MOF has continued sale of foreign currency funds partially in the foreign exchange market (sale of foreign currency funds in the CB was also used)."
2015,182,Portugal,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Portugal participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2015,453,Qatar,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The targeted peg was officially authorized by Amiri Decree No. 34 of 2001 issued in July 2001, replacing the de jure exchange rate policy of pegging to the SDR, which had been in effect since 1975. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) does not publish data on its interventions."
2015,634,Republic of Congo (Congo),973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. The Republic of Congo participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CEMAC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (Joint Monetary Committee) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to amend the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2015,968,Romania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) may intervene to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations. There is no formal definition of excessive exchange rate fluctuations: the assessment is based on domestic and international market circumstances and on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The NBR intervenes either directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers. The NBR does not publish information on its interventions. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement.
2015,922,Russia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"As of November 10, 2014, the Bank of Russia (BR) eliminated the operational band for the values of the dual currency basket (0.55 U.S. dollar + 0.45 euro) and regular foreign exchange interventions on the borders of this band and outside the band, adopting a de jure free floating exchange rate arrangement. Under this arrangement, the exchange rate of the ruble is determined by market factors. Following the transition to the free floating exchange rate arrangement, the Bank of Russia retained the ability to perform interventions in the domestic foreign exchange market in the event of threats to financial stability. In order to maintain the stability of the domestic foreign exchange market and to ensure that Russian credit and nonfinancial institutions are able to continue the uninterrupted servicing of external debt under the conditions of international financial sanctions and a reduction in foreign exchange earnings from exports due to the decline in world oil prices, since the second half of 2014 the Bank of Russia has also been supplying Russian credit institutions with foreign currency on the condition that it be repaid, through one-day foreign exchange swap transactions involving the sale of U.S. dollars for rubles; through 1-week, 28-day, and 12-month repo operations; and through loans in foreign currency with 28-day and 365-day maturities (the performance of 12-month repo operations in foreign currency was suspended by the Bank of Russia effective June 1 through December 13, 2015, and effective April 1, 2016). In addition, on May 13, 2015, the Bank of Russia announced its intention to increase the volume of international reserves to US$500 billion. To do this, the Bank of Russia may purchase foreign currency in the domestic foreign exchange market, while the actual exchange rate of the ruble or certain conditions governing the functioning of the domestic foreign exchange market for the performance or suspension of these operations are not established. Operations are performed in small volumes on a uniform basis throughout the day, so as not to influence the intraday dynamics of the rubleʹs exchange rate. In 2015, purchases of foreign currency in the domestic foreign exchange market to replenish international reserves were performed by the Bank of Russia effective from May 13 through July 27, 2015; the total amount of these transactions was equal to US$10.1 billion. The Bank of Russia has not performed foreign currency interventions aimed at maintaining financial stability since December 16, 2014 (information about the frequency and volumes of the Bank of Russiaʹs foreign currency interventions is posted on the Bank of Russiaʹs website under the “Liquidity of the banking sector and monetary policy instruments” subsection of the “Statistics” section. Throughout 2015, the conditions in the Russian foreign exchange market were shaped by various external and internal factors. The relatively tight monetary policy pursued by the Bank of Russia throughout 2015, as well as the use of instruments to supply credit institutions with foreign currency on the condition that it be repaid, helped to stabilize the situation in the domestic foreign exchange market following the confidence shock experienced at the end of 2014. However, instability in the world oil market and the expectation of a rise in the key rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve put depreciation pressure on the domestic foreign exchange market by the end of 2015. Because the BR has not intervened from end-July 2015 and that data on intervention is publically available, the de facto exchange arrangement has been reclassified to free floating from a floating arrangement, effective July 29, 2015."
2015,714,Rwanda,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has intervened directly in order to prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Since March 2015, the franc has increased in volatility, depreciating 7.6% in 2015, while still being managed. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed from a crawl-like arrangement, effective March 4, 2015. The BNR discloses its data on its interventions on the market."
2015,862,Samoa,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) does not publish data on its interventions. Currently, there is no legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement, except the CBS Act of 2015, which states only that the CBS is responsible for setting the exchange rate."
2015,135,San Marino,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. On March 27, 2012, San Marino signed a monetary agreement with the EU repealing the previous monetary agreement of November 29, 2000. The agreement authorizes San Marino to use the euro as its official currency, grant legal tender status to euro banknotes and coins, and issue limited quantities of euro coins. San Marino is committed to adopting the relevant EU legislation (on euro banknotes and coins; combating fraud and counterfeiting; banking and financial legislation, including the prevention of money laundering and statistical reporting requirements) within the time specified by that agreement. The list of legal acts to be implemented and the time limits for their transposition are reviewed each year by a “Joint Committee” as provided for by Articles 8 and 11 of the monetary Agreement."
2015,716,São Tomé and Príncipe,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg against the euro. Beginning February 1, 2009, the focus of the BCSTP switched from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which became the new reference currency for the peg on January 1, 2010. The Organic Law of the BCSTP authorizes it to make decisions regarding exchange rate policy."
2015,456,Saudi Arabia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rate of the riyal against the U.S. dollar is determined by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Agency (SAMA) and has been stable since June 1986. The SAMA, in coordination with the minister of finance, decides on changes in the exchange rate arrangement. Historically, the SAMA has not published its intervention data."
2015,722,Senegal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Senegal participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2015,942,Serbia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"In accordance with the revised IMF classification system of exchange rate arrangements, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The current Decision on the Dinar Exchange Rate Regime stipulates “managed floating.” Since the introduction of this exchange rate regime in 2001 and in accordance with its commitment to liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has tried to reduce its participation in the foreign exchange market and to adjust the features of the existing exchange rate regime in the direction of soft managed floating, so as to pave the way for a freely floating exchange rate regime in the future. This exchange rate regime enables the NBS to balance, when necessary, foreign exchange demand and supply and moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate in either direction (appreciation or depreciation) that may occur under the influence of external or internal shocks to the national economy. The NBS interventions do not aim to achieve a particular level of the exchange rate. Interventions in the foreign exchange market take place only to moderate excessive daily short-term volatility of the exchange rate of the dinar, in either direction (appreciation or depreciation), in order to contain threats to financial and price stability and safeguard an adequate level of foreign exchange reserves. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2015,718,Seychelles,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand in the market. The Central Bank of Seychelles (CBS) intervenes only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility. The CBS occasionally participates in the foreign exchange market for reserve accumulation. Operational guidelines designate the CBS as the buyer and seller of last resort in the foreign exchange market. Given the rupeeʹs increased volatility and departure from the 2% band against the U.S. dollar since April 2014, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The CBS discloses intervention data on its website, which is publicly accessible. The Seychelles rupee appreciated vis-à-vis the major international currencies in 2015 except against the U.S. dollar due to lower demand for foreign exchange on the domestic market."
2015,724,Sierra Leone,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is floating, as the exchange rate of the leone is market determined. The Bank of Sierra Leone (BSL) does not target a specific level of the exchange rate. Occasionally, it buys or sells foreign exchange in the market to build up its reserves and sells to the market as part of its open market operations through the foreign exchange auction. The foreign exchange auction data is published on the BSL website. In the first half of 2015 the exchange rate was relatively stable, and by August 2015 it depreciated significantly as a result of 50% reduction in the supply of foreign exchange into the market."
2015,576,Singapore,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. The authorities manage the exchange rate as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the objective of maintaining price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. The Singapore dollar is allowed to fluctuate within a targeted policy band and is managed against a basket of currencies of the countryʹs major trading partners and competitors. Currencies in the basket are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the countries in Singaporeʹs trade relations with the world. The exchange rate policy is announced every six months in the Monetary Policy Statement, typically in terms of changes to the slope, central rate, and width of the policy band. In response to changing macroeconomic conditions, the policy parameters may also be adjusted outside the regular biannual cycle. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. In 2015, the Singapore dollar remained stable within a 2% band against a currency composite. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) intervenes through agents and does not publish information on its interventions."
2015,936,Slovak Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. The Slovak Republic participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2015,961,Slovenia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Slovenia participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2015,813,Solomon Islands,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime pegs the Solomon Islands dollar (SBD) to a basket of currencies. The policy aims to ensure price stability and maintain a managed exchange rate policy in line with economic fundamentals and offer some flexibility. The SBD was expected to fluctuate on a daily basis but within a managed ±1% band around the base rate. In May 2014, the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) revised the exchange rate management policy that modifies the exchange rate formula applied to implement the exchange rate policy pegging the SBD to an invoice-weighted basket of currencies. The aim was to (1) ensure that daily management of the exchange rate follows the basket peg more closely to achieve a constant and stable exchange rate; (2) ensure that the currency peg does not lead to real exchange rate misalignment (overvaluation, etc.) in the presence of inflation differentials with the Solomon Islandsʹ trading partners; and (3) review the merits of widening the current band of ±1% to ±1.5% around the base parity of the bilateral (SBD–U.S. dollar) exchange rate in order to benefit more fully from the advantages of a basket peg. The SBD per U.S. dollar value is the value of the index multiplied by the SBD per U.S. dollar value on the day the basket peg was introduced. The exchange rate (midrate) is now expressed in SBDs per U.S. dollar and is determined by the total index of the basket multiplied by the initial base rate expressed in SBDs rather than U.S. dollars, as was done previously. The midrate is announced as the official rate. The bank removed the band ?1% and +1% in October 2014 to allow greater flexibility in the basket movements."
2015,726,Somalia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The currency of Somalia is the Somali shilling (SOS). However, the de facto currency is the U.S. dollar. Dollar banknotes are used as cash currency with Somali banknotes serving as a subdenomination. Neighboring country currencies are used in border areas. Mobile phone payments, with transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, are widely used. Most transactions are settled in U.S. dollars. The shilling exchange rate has remained broadly stable in recent years at So. Sh. 20,000 per U.S. dollar. During May 2015, the rate depreciated briefly to So. Sh. 23,500 per U.S. dollar in response to an influx of new, counterfeit notes. The de jure exchange rate arrangement is undetermined. Due to the absence of administrative measures controlling the level of the exchange rate and the inoperative status of the CBS in the foreign exchange market, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a free-floating arrangement."
2015,199,South Africa,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free-floating. The exchange rate of the rand is determined by demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has a publicly announced foreign exchange policy of purchasing foreign currency in the local foreign exchange market from time to time, when market conditions permit, with the aim of accumulating foreign exchange reserves without seeking to influence the level of the exchange rate. The SARB interacts with ADs as the price taker for official and commercial purposes. The market makers and brokers quote prices to other market participants; the SARB does not quote prices for market participants. The SARB does not publish information on its interventions (only monthly releases of the official gold and foreign exchange reserves). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2015,733,South Sudan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Effective December 15, 2015, the BSS introduced a de jure floating exchange rate regime, abandoning the conventional peg arrangement. The Press Release of December 14, 2015, announced that (1) effective December 15, 2015, all foreign exchange businesses shall be transacted at the market-determined exchange rate; (2) the BSS shall introduce U.S. dollar purchase and sale auctions occasionally; and (3) the BCC shall repeal the foreign exchange controls. On December 15, 2015, the BSS indicative selling rate stood at SSP 18.70/US$ completely eliminating the spread between the parallel exchange rate and the official rate. The parallel market exchange rate also traded at SSP 18.7/US$ on that day. A week later the BSS conducted the first auction and 22 of the 29 banks participated. The spread between the official rate and the parallel market rate, which exceeded 400% before December 15, was reduced to below 1%. However, the spread started to widen slightly in February, reflecting teething problems with the BSSʹ auction system and the slow start of foreign exchange interbank market. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from conventional peg, effective December 15, 2015."
2015,184,Spain,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Spain participates in a currency union (EMU) with, as of January 1, 2015, 18 other members (previously 17) of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2015,524,Sri Lanka,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating since its introduction by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on January 23, 2001. The Sri Lankan rupee remained broadly stable during the first eight months of 2015, but depreciated substantially thereafter, as a result of the CB decision to allow greater flexibility in the determination of the exchange rate. The rupee recorded a marginal depreciation of 2.42% against the U.S. dollar during the first eight months of the year. Effective September 4, 2015, the CB decided to limit its intervention in the domestic foreign exchange market and allowed the exchange rate to be largely determined by the demand and supply conditions of the market. This resulted in the Sri Lankan rupee depreciating by 6.64% against the U.S. dollar, during the period from September 4 to end-2015. Overall, the rupee depreciated against the U.S. dollar by about 9% to SL Rs 144.06 as of end-2015. Because the Sri Lanka rupee has followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since October 2014, with one realignment in September 2015, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been retroactively reclassified from a stabilized arrangement to a crawl-like arrangement, effective October 13, 2014. The CBSL publishes intervention data on its website and in its annual report."
2015,361,St. Kitts and Nevis,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Kitts and Nevis participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2015,362,St. Lucia,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Lucia participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement at EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2015,364,St. Vincent and the Grenadines,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Vincent and the Grenadines participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement at EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2015,732,Sudan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating. MFR used by commercial banks is determined in the interbank market, in which participants deal directly with each other. The CBOS participates in the market through swaps under a rules-based mechanism that triggers intervention if the exchange rate exceeds a band of ±4% around the previous dayʹs closing rate. The main objective of the policy is exchange rate stability. Sudanʹs multiple exchange rate regime includes (1) a CB rate that also applies to payment of government obligations and customs valuation. The rate of customs valuation is revised daily but not necessarily at CBOS rate; (2) a gold exchange rate used by the CBOS for gold transactions; and (3) an MFR used mainly by commercial banks and exchange bureaus. The MFR applies to all other transactions and has two components: (1) an indicative rate; and (2) a flexibility factor that allows banks to deviate from the average of the indicative rate and the incentive by a range of ±4%. The rate for collecting customs revenue changes daily. In 2015, the official exchange rate was kept broadly unchanged, with an adjustment of the official rate of only 2% at SDG 6.1 per U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified from other managed to a stabilized arrangement, effective January 1, 2015. The CBOS does not disclose information on its interventions to the public."
2015,366,Suriname,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. In accordance with a July 1994 presidential decree, the exchange rate is determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange. The exchange rate of the Surinamese dollar vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar in the official market remained stable until January 20, 2011, when the authorities devalued the currency by 20%, to SRD 3.30 per U.S. dollar, and set a band of SRD 3.25–3.35 per U.S. dollar, within which all official and commercial market transactions may take place. Effective November 19, 2015, the authorities devalued the currency by 21% to SRD4.0 per U.S. dollar, and set a band of SRD 3.96–4.04 per U.S. dollar for official transactions and SRD 3.8–4.2 per U.S. dollar for commercial market transactions. In February 6, 2016, the CBvS announced it would start conducting weekly foreign exchange auction with commercial banks. The average auction rate will be the official exchange rate. However, the details on buying and selling rate are not announced yet. Because the Surinamese dollar–U.S. dollar exchange rate remained stabilized within a narrower band during 2015, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2015,734,Swaziland,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The Central Bank of Swaziland Order of 1974 is the legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement.
2015,144,Sweden,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the krona is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are allowed under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., participation in concerted interventions with other CBs). Sveriges Riksbank (SR) announces its intervention in a press communiqué, explains the motive, and discloses the framework of intervention. However, no intervention has been reported since June 14, 2001."
2015,146,Switzerland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market. However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free-market rates. On September 6, 2011, the SNB set a minimum exchange rate floor of CHF 1.20 per euro to contain deflationary risks. Effective January 15, 2015, the SNB decided to discontinue the minimum exchange rate floor of CHF 1.20 per euro. Ever since, the franc has been floating between 0.97 and 1.12 CHF per euro, with the SNB intervening occasionally. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a floating from a crawl-like arrangement, effective January 15, 2015. The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual accountability report."
2015,463,Syria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Following the political crisis, a parallel foreign exchange market emerged in early April 2011, diverging from the official rate by about 15%. The rate in the parallel market moved erratically, reaching LS 105 per U.S. dollar in March 2012. During this time, the CBS gradually adjusted the official rate toward convergence with the market rate. On March 10, 2012, the CBS announced that it would trade foreign currency with money dealers at rates other than the official rate published in its daily bulletin. This new price list, called the “intervention list,” is much closer to market prices and has helped ease pressure on the market and bring the market rate closer to the official rate. By December 31, 2012, the official and parallel rates had come under additional pressure, and the two rates diverged by 28%, with the official rate reaching LS 71 per U.S. dollar and the parallel rate widening to LS 91 per U.S. dollar. As of December 12, 2015, the parallel rate was LS 395 per U.S. dollar while the official rate stood at LS 221 per U.S. dollar. The gap between the official and parallel rate widened in 2015 compared to 2014. Given the developments in the official rate, the emergence of the parallel market, and the intervention rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2015,923,Tajikistan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, with no predetermined path. The exchange rate of the somoni is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, in which the NBT may intervene to limit exchange rate volatility. In 2015, the exchange rate increased its volatility and depreciation rate against the U.S. dollar from TJS 5.3074–TJS 6.9902 to US$1, or by 31.7%. Of this indicator, 18.1% falls in the months of January–April and 13.6% in May–December 2015. Moreover, the exchange rate on the cash market went from TJS 5.47 to TJS 7.58, a change of 38.6%. Of this indicator, 24.6% falls in the months of January–April and 13.5% in May–December 2015. Over the period from January 1, 2016, through April 18, 2016, the official TJS to U.S. dollar exchange rate fell from TJS 7.1101 to TJS 7.8696 to US$1, or by 10.7%. Of this indicator, 10.4% falls in the month of January 2016. Moreover, the exchange rate on the cash market went from TJS 7.58 to TJS 7.93, or a change of 4.6%. Of this indicator, the somoni exchange rate dropped by 15.4% in January 2016 and strengthened by 10.2% in February 2016. As of April 18, 2016, this same currency exchange arrangement is legally in force. The NBT publishes monthly information on the scope of its transactions on the domestic currency exchange market in the Banking Statistics Bulletin, and in special press releases that are posted on the NBT website and other news media, in which explanations are provided of NBT policies undertaken to regulate the domestic currency exchange market. For purposes of regulating the exchange rate formation process on the cash segment of the U.S. dollar buy/sell market during a period of excessive fluctuation in the exchange rate, the NBT set a daily rate for purchases and sales of U.S. dollar in cash. Effective October 26, 2015, the NBT cancelled the procedure for setting rates for purchases and sales of U.S. dollars in cash and reinstated lending institutionsʹ right and authority to independently set these rates, on the condition that the selling rate may not be set higher than 1.5% of the official TJS to U.S. dollar exchange rate. This procedure is applied only in the cash segment of the domestic currency exchange market for retail transactions with the public. (NBT Instruction No. 07.03/487-3610 of October 20, 2015) The de facto exchange rate was reclassified to other managed from a crawl-like arrangement, effective March 16, 2015."
2015,738,Tanzania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. In recent years, the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) has participated in the interbank foreign exchange market mostly on the selling side. The policy intention of selling U.S. dollars has been to sterilize liquidity generated by government spending of aid funds. BOT foreign exchange sales have varied depending on the liquidity in the economy and the amount and effectiveness of other monetary policy instruments. The BOT informs the market of the target sale of foreign exchange in two months. Trading in the interbank foreign exchange market is conducted using the Reuters trading platform in a two-way quote system. The BOT is not required to indicate two-way quotes when it participates in the interbank market. While the shilling appears to have stabilized since January 2016, further observations are necessary to determine the new trend of the exchange rate. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as floating."
2015,578,Thailand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. Under the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the value of the baht is allowed to be determined by market forces, reflecting demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. In the case that the resulting movements in Thai baht (THB) are deemed excessive and unjustified by fundamentals, foreign exchange rate intervention can be undertaken. In 2015, THB depreciated by 8.6% against U.S. dollar, while in terms of nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and real effective exchange rate (REER), it depreciated by 2.3% and 4.8%, respectively. The average volatility of THB in 2015 was about 5%. THB depreciation trend in 2015 started in late April after a rate cut by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC). The continued depreciation during the remaining part of the year, however, was mainly driven by external factors especially Fedʹs normalization and concerns on Chinaʹs economic slowdown and its foreign exchange policy uncertainty. In the beginning of 2016, THB depreciated due to global risk-off sentiment caused by concerns on China slowdown and further drop in oil prices. However, THB has rebounded since late January mainly owing to capital inflows triggered by renewed search for yield behavior after growing expectation on delayed Fed rate hike and ECB and Bank of Japan (BOJ) further easing monetary policies. Year-to-date (end-March), THB has appreciated by around 2.4% against U.S. dollar, while in terms of NEER (February-16), it has appreciated by 0.8%. Nevertheless, in terms of REER (January-16), THB has depreciated by 0.2%."

2015,648,The Gambia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Gambia participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the dalasi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15% of the central rate; however, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures. The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange to augment international reserves and ensure market orderliness. The government of Gambia announced, on May 4, 2015, that the U.S. dollar cannot be exchanged for more than 40 dalasis per U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from a floating arrangement, effective May 4, 2015. The CBG does not publish intervention data."
2015,537,Timor-Leste,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely.
2015,742,Togo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Togo participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded on December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2015,866,Tonga,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. The external value of the paʹanga is determined on the basis of a weighted currency basket comprising the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and Fijian dollar. The basket weights are determined based on the proportions of trade with trading partners. The weights are not published. The exchange rate of the paʹanga in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) within a band of ±5% a month. The NRBT does not publish intervention data. Under Section 34 of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act, the external value of the paʹanga is determined from time to time in a manner approved by the NRBT board, after consultation with the Minister of Finance and National Planning, in view of Tongaʹs obligations connected with international monetary agreements in which it takes part. Section 35(1) of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act empowers the NRBT to set the exchange rate."
2015,369,Trinidad and Tobago,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Given the stability of the Trinidad and Tobago dollar against the U.S. dollar, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) routinely issues press releases on its direct intervention in the foreign exchange market."
2015,744,Tunisia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, as indicated on the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT) website. On April 18, 2012, a fixing arrangement (i.e., the average of market participantsʹ quotes) replaced the currency composite as the reference exchange rate published by the BCT. The BCT intervenes in the foreign exchange market in the event of a high level of demand that exceeds the capacity of banksʹ foreign exchange positions. Previously, the BCT intervened to keep the exchange rate stable vis-à-vis a currency composite using its own rates in response to requests from banks for quotes. The rates quoted by the BCT were based on the currency composite and updated continuously to reflect the exchange rates prevailing in the international foreign exchange markets. In 2015, the dinar followed a depreciating trend vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar–euro basket within a margin of less than 2%. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BCT posts the volume of transactions between authorized intermediaries and the volume of its daily interventions in the interbank foreign exchange market on its website."
2015,186,Turkey,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lira is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) announced the general framework of the monetary and exchange rate policies envisaged for 2016 in a presentation titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2016” on December 9, 2015. The CBRT may intervene directly or through flexible auctions in the market in both directions, in case of unhealthy price formation due to speculative behavior stemming from a loss of market depth. In that case, the CBRT may buy or sell foreign exchange at the rates quoted by the banks directly. The results of the CBRTʹs daily auctions and volume of its interventions are published on its website. The CBRT introduced the reserve option mechanism (ROM) as a new monetary policy tool. In this framework, the CBRT allows banks to hold a fraction of their mandatory reserves for lira liabilities in foreign currency and gold. The CBRT may increase or decrease the reserve option coefficients (ROCs), the amount of foreign currency or gold required to meet one unit of Turkish lira required reserve. Typically, the ROC is an increasing function of different tranches of lira required reserves; the tranches of the mechanism and the corresponding levels of ROC are determined by the CBRT. The ROM has been used as an active policy tool by the CBRT and has contributed to stabilization of capital flow volatility, indirectly influencing exchange rate movement. Given the CBRTʹs policy focus on limiting exchange rate volatility through the ROM, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2015,925,Turkmenistan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT) is responsible for exchange rate policy implementation. The Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan (CMT) takes ultimate responsibility for economic policy decisions.

2015,746,Uganda,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The authorities intervene in Ugandaʹs foreign exchange market when short-term fluctuations jeopardize its orderly operation. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM) at the banksʹ quoted rates using the best bid-ask principle. The BOU publishes information on its interventions in its monthly, quarterly, and annual reports, including amounts purchased and sold through the reserve buildup program, interventions, and targeted transactions."
2015,926,Ukraine,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The monetary policy strategy for 2016–2020 calls for the NBU to maintain a floating exchange rate arrangement, meaning that monetary policy will not be aimed at achieving a certain exchange rate target or range. At the same time, the NBU will use foreign currency interventions for the purpose of accumulation of international reserves, smoothing out the functioning of the foreign exchange market, and maintaining the transmission of the key interest as the core monetary policy instrument."
2015,466,United Arab Emirates,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The dirham was pegged to the U.S. dollar in 1980. A January 2003 decision made the peg official. The United Arab Emirates Central Bank (UAECB) does not publish its intervention data.
2015,112,United Kingdom,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating. The exchange rate of the pound sterling is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of England (BOE) has a separate pool of foreign exchange reserves, which it uses at its discretion to intervene in support of its monetary policy objectives. A monthly press release issued by Her Majestyʹs Treasury (HMT) reports HMT and BOE intervention. There were no foreign exchange interventions during 2015."
2015,111,United States,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating; the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are not formally ruled out in the United States, but they are rarely used. The secretary of the treasury is responsible for the formulation and implementation of international monetary and financial policy, including foreign exchange market intervention policy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has separate legal authority to engage in foreign exchange operations, which are conducted in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury to ensure consistency with U.S. international monetary and financial policy. The Treasury and the Fed have closely coordinated their foreign exchange operations since early 1962, when the Fed commenced such operations at the request of the Treasury. Operations are conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as fiscal agent of the United States and as the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. Interventions are announced when they occur and the size of the interventions is reported in the Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations quarterly bulletin. U.S. authorities last intervened in the foreign exchange market in March 2011, following the earthquake in Japan, in a coordinated G7 effort to sell Japanese yen. The United States did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2015."
2015,298,Uruguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the peso is determined on the basis of supply and demand, although the CBU reserves the right to intervene to cushion abrupt changes in a concentrated market of few transactions. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. For the past two years the CB has been periodically intervening on the exchange market to smooth excess exchange rate volatility. While interventions increased in the second half of 2015, they have abated since December, despite the ongoing and accelerated depreciation of the currency. The CBU publishes information on intervention on its website."
2015,927,Uzbekistan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of the supply of and demand for foreign exchange (Article 15 of Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 556-II on Foreign Exchange Regulation of December 11, 2003). The sum–U.S. dollar exchange rate is used as an operational benchmark, since 95% of the countryʹs trading operations are carried out in U.S. dollars. With the aim of preventing sharp movements in the exchange rate and supporting the exchange rate level that is in line with targeted macroeconomic indicators and monetary policy, the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan (CBU) participates in currency trading, acting as a buyer and seller of U.S. dollars and euros. Given that the sum has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2015,846,Vanuatu,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Since 1988, Vanuatu has officially maintained an adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement. Currently, the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a transaction-weighted (trade and tourism receipts) basket of currencies whose weights and composition are not publicly disclosed and are adjusted periodically. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed, because the composite weights are not disclosed and cannot be confirmed, and, in practice, the vatu has been slightly more volatile against a composite than the 2% band typical of stabilized or pegged arrangements."
2015,299,Venezuela,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate is a conventional peg against the U.S. dollar. Exchange Agreement No. 14 of February 8, 2013 (G.O. No. 40,108 of February 8, 2013) sets the exchange rate at Bs 6.30/USD (selling) and Bs 6.2842/USD (buying). There are three additional official exchange rates: (1) The rate produced by the Complementary Foreign Exchange Administration System (SICAD) in special auctions by this system of foreign exchange or securities denominated in foreign currencies issued by the Republic, which stood at Bs 13.15/USD at the end of 2015 (Exchange Agreement No. 26 of April 3, 2014 published in G.O. No. 40,391 of April 10, 2014). (2) The rate derived from the Alternative Foreign Exchange System (SICAD II), which is the weighted average of daily transactions via this system for the purchase and sale of foreign exchange or securities denominated in foreign currencies. However, operations via SICAD II were suspended, effective February 12, 2015. The last exchange rate established by this system was Bs 51.9710/USD buying and Bs 52.1013/USD selling (Exchange Agreement No. 27 of March 10, 2014, G.O No. 40,368 of March 10, 2014). Nevertheless, the reference rate will continue to be applied to foreign currency purchase and sale operations, as well as the fulfillment of the obligations subject, under the exchange regulations, to the weighted average exchange rate of the operations performed each day through SICAD II until a new rate is determined, which will be publicized by the appropriate means. The same exchange rate will be applicable to the obligations included in Exchange Agreement No. 33 of February 10, 2015, which set as the reference exchange rate the one indicated in Article 24 of said instrument, until the entry into operation of any of the foreign exchange markets regulated therein that allow the publication of the new exchange rate governing them. (3) Effective February 10, 2015, the weighted average of the following operations regulated by Exchange Agreement No. 33 of February 10, 2015: (a) the trading, in domestic currency, of foreign exchange offered via the foreign exchange desks of duly authorized microfinance banks and universal banks and (b) the trading, in domestic currency, of securities denominated in foreign currencies by universal banks, licensed securities brokers, and the Bicentennial Public Securities Exchange in its capacity as an AD (Exchange Agreement No. 33 of February 10, 2015, Special G.O. No. 6,171 of February 10, 2015). Said weighted average stood at Bs 198.2018/USD buying and Bs 198.6986/USD selling at the end of 2015."
2015,582,Vietnam,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Clause 2, Article 15 Decree No. 70/2014/ ND-CP of July 17, 2014, clarifies: (1) The official exchange rate is determined based on demand and supply in the foreign exchange market under State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) regulations. The SBV regulates the exchange rate by deploying monetary policy instruments and intervening in the foreign exchange market. (2) The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, and is determined by the SBV based on a currency basket of countries with trade, financing, and investment relationships with Vietnam consistent with macroeconomic targets of each period. Effective December 31, 2015, Decision No. 2730/QD-NHNN specifies that the central exchange rate is announced daily, based on reference of the interbank weighted exchange rate, exchange rate developments in global markets of some currencies whose are Vietnamʹs major investment, credit, and trading partners, monetary and macroeconomic balances, and monetary policy targets. In 2015, the dong remained stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar with two realignments in March and August. Effective August 19, 2015, the dong–U.S. dollar exchange rate might fluctuate around the official exchange rate within a daily transaction band of ±3% (from ±1% to ±2% on August 12, 2015, and from ±2% to ±3% on August 19, 2015). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2015,474,Yemen,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been free floating since July 1996. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) receives most of the foreign exchange proceeds, particularly crude oil export revenues, official loans, and official development assistance. The official exchange rate was steady at about Yrls 213.80 per U.S. dollar throughout 2011 and the first half of 2012, after which it hovered around Yrls 214.89 per U.S. dollar until 2014. The dollar exchange rate in the parallel market was Yrls 228.00 per U.S. dollar at the end of 2011. It gradually converged with the official rate by mid-2012, which led to the unification of the exchange rates. Given the unification of the official and parallel market rates and stability of the exchange rate against the U.S. dollar since June 2012, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2015,754,Zambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The official exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) intervenes primarily through transactions with ADs, which are registered commercial banks that meet the prescribed eligibility criteria under the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) Framework. BOZ interventions are published as historical data, and its foreign exchange transactions are published in the biweekly statistics. While the Zambian Kwacha appears to follow a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since mid-December 2015, further observations are necessary to determine the new trend of the exchange rate. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as floating."
2015,698,Zimbabwe,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The Zimbabwean dollar is no longer used as the domestic currency for economic, financial, and administrative purposes as of February 2009. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The Zimbabwean dollar demonetized through Statutory Instrument 70 of 2015, gazetted on June 12, 2015; the process lasted from June 15, 2015, to September 30, 2015. The purpose of demonetization of the local unit was to promote consumer confidence and business confidence by providing credibility to the multicurrency system and legally retiring the Zimbabwean dollar."
2016,512,Afghanistan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market through three times-weekly selling auctions. The results are published on the DAB website. The DAB deals with ADs only through the auction. The primary goal of these auctions is to regulate the growth of reserve money and/or currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction exchange rate volatility. The Afghani appreciated against U.S dollar by around 2% in 2016. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2016,914,Albania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lek is based on supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) is not usually active in this market. In accordance with its regulations, intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) calming a disorderly market, which arises due to seasonality and lack of market depth. Interbank market bid-ask spreads, total market turnover, and speed of one-way moves are taken into consideration when intervening to calm a disorderly market. Excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market is considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementing and Advising the Monetary Policy. Foreign exchange market liquidity has improved over time, and the last time the BOA intervened to calm a disorderly market was in the first half of 2009; (2) considerable exchange rate misalignment with fundamentals: The lek is considered misaligned with fundamentals if there is lengthy overshooting of the exchange rate in any side; and (3) to increase the international reserves at the BOA. To this purpose, the level of interventions is assessed based on an optimization model of holding reserves, and constrained by the minimum threshold of accumulating foreign reserves to cover at least four months of imports in the medium-term as well as the countryʹs short-term external debt. When the BOA intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market, its counterparties are the commercial banks; if necessary, it may carry out its intervention with foreign exchange bureaus. The BOA intervenes through (1) verbal intervention, in the form of press releases in the print or electronic media and/or press conferences; and (2) transactional intervention. The latter can take two forms, direct intervention and intervention via preannounced auctions. In the case of direct intervention, the exchange rate is determined by commercial banksʹ quotes and the BOA Monetary Operations Departmentʹs quotes. When the intervention exchange rate is uniform for all counterparties, the BOA publishes that rate on its Reuters page and simultaneously communicates the rate to commercial banks that do not participate in the Reuters system and to foreign exchange bureaus with which it has contact. When different exchange rates are used, the BOA announces only the fact that it has intervened. It publishes with a three-month lag the amount of the intervention in a quarterly bulletin that summarizes its foreign exchange operations with banks and the public sector. The regulation regarding foreign exchange interventions includes the option to carry out transactional interventions via auctions announced in advance. The BOA announces the date, amount, and currency it wants to buy at least one month before the auction, and the banks submit one bid each (in an amount equal to the limit it has provided the BOA). The BOA decides how much to buy based on the rates offered and its target amount. Following the auction, the BOA publishes the amount offered by commercial banks, the amount accepted by the BOA, the range of offered bids, the range of accepted bids, and the prorate at the maximum accepted bid. Swaps with the central government constitute an indirect intervention channel. The BOA aims to avoid disruptions from large and irregular demand of foreign exchange by MOF, to better manage liquidity. In 2016, the exchange rate has marginally appreciated as a result of large official inflows, FDI, and tourism income. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2016,612,Algeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Bank of Algeria (BA) does not announce the path of the exchange rate. The external value of the dinar is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the BA is the main seller because of significant inflows related to commodity exports, including hydrocarbons, which, under current law, must be surrendered to the BA. The BA manages the dinar with reference to a basket of currencies, and the rate of the dinar relative to the currencies in the basket is based on balance of payments data. The BA has not set a target range for fluctuation of the dinar outside or within any particular band, and the observed exchange rate movements do not confirm any constant weights of the currency composite. The dinarʹs depreciation against the dollar continued in the first half of 2016. Since May 2016, the dinar has been roughly stable against the dollar. In June 2016, the BA indicated that they would pause the depreciation of the dinar until a forward market was in place, which would allow economic actors to hedge their foreign exchange risk. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BA does not disclose information about its interventions."
2016,614,Angola,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; however, the BNA closely monitors exchange rate fluctuations to try to maintain price stability in the economy and frequently intervenes in the foreign exchange market by holding foreign exchange auctions and direct sales. The BNA and the commercial banks determine the recipients of foreign exchange and prioritize certain imports. The BNA receives foreign exchange from the taxes paid by oil companies to the government, and buys foreign exchange from oil companies that make payments to residents for services provided to them in kwanza. After depreciating by 22.6% in the first four months of 2016, the kwanza was stabilized vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar since mid-April 2016. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to stabilized arrangement from other managed arrangement, effective April 15, 2016. The BNA publishes the auction results and respective reference rates."
2016,311,Antigua and Barbuda,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Antigua and Barbuda participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2016,213,Argentina,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the peso, which is determined in the MULC (Mercado Único y Libre de Cambios—Local Foreign Exchange Market) by supply and demand, applies to all transactions in foreign exchange and foreign currency banknotes. A process to dismantle foreign exchange controls began as of December 17, 2015 and is intended to provide the Argentine economy with greater flexibility to address adverse international contexts. Notwithstanding the above, the BCRA reserves the power to operate in the exchange market to manage its balance sheet and prevent unjustified fluctuations in the exchange rate."
2016,911,Armenia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The CBA intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility, defined as short-term, high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by speculative or trend-following elements rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The CBA intervenes anonymously mainly via auctions of foreign exchange, or openly in the interbank market, or through the stock exchange. The CBA publishes weekly intervention data through the stock exchange only on its website every Monday."
2016,314,Aruba,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The legal documents that established the fixed exchange rate arrangement are AB 1992 No. GT 6 State Decree for Fixing Parity of the Aruban Florin and Notice on Foreign Exchange Transactions 90/A2.
2016,193,Australia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"Both the de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as free floating. However, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) retains discretionary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market and has done so during periods of significant market disorder and/or gross misalignment of the exchange rate. Given the high level of development of the Australian foreign exchange market, interventions have been rare. The most recent period of intervention was in 2007–08 and was in response to episodes of significant market disorder—that is, instances when market functioning was impaired to such a degree that it was clear that the observed volatility was excessive. Australia has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 2016. The RBA may also vary the way intervention is conducted; it may enter the interbank foreign exchange market directly through voice or electronic brokerage platforms or use an agent bank. As a matter of government policy, most wholesale purchases of foreign currency by government agencies are made through the RBA. The RBA manages the flows from purchases on behalf of the government so as to minimize their market impact—e.g., by executing these trades when the market is liquid and, if necessary, breaking up the required purchases into a series of smaller transactions. Monthly purchases and sales of foreign exchange are published on the RBA website. Daily data on foreign exchange market interventions are published on the RBA website annually, following the release of the RBA Annual Report."
2016,122,Austria,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Austria participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2016,912,Azerbaijan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Effective January 12, 2017, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) announced a change of the de jure exchange rate arrangement to a free floating from a managed floating arrangement, and eliminated the requirement for banks to buy or sell foreign currency at a range of no more than 4% from the official exchange rate. The exchange rate of manat will rest on fundamental factors determining the supply and demand ratio in the foreign exchange market. Under this decision, the CBA initiated a new currency auction mechanism, while limits on fluctuation of the market currency exchange rate compared to the official rate were eliminated. The new auction mechanism will be organized on the unilateral basis, in which the CBA provides the auctionʹs operational platform, and the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ). Currency will be realized on the basis of offered prices by the market players. This mechanism implies selling currency to the customer offering the higher price at the first place. The amount of the currency to be offered at an auction will be announced in advance. Previously, the CBA intervened to smooth out excess volatility and influences the market exchange rate by intervening in the foreign exchange market to maintain the official rate within a prescribed corridor of ± 4%, and had an exchange rate policy based on a currency basket comprising the U.S. dollar and the euro. Since December 2015, as a result of official action, the manat has been allowed to gradually depreciate based on supply and demand factors vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. Further observations are needed for a reclassification to floating or free floating. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as other managed. The CBA publishes its foreign exchange intervention data quarterly."
2016,419,Bahrain,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rate is published in the Official Gazette of the CBB.
2016,513,Bangladesh,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. Bangladesh Bank (BB) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to contain undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Since November 2013 the taka has been kept broadly stable against the U.S. dollar, fluctuating well within a 2% band. While the exchange rate has depreciated since January 2017, more observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a stabilized arrangement. The BB publishes information on its interventions in its periodic publications (e.g., Annual Report)."
2016,316,Barbados,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The minister of finance, after consultation with the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), pegged the Barbados dollar to the U.S. dollar on July 5, 1975, pursuant to the Exchange Control Act and the Central Bank of Barbados Act. Intervention data are published in Economic and Financial Statistics Section H, Table 2."
2016,913,Belarus,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating. On January 9, 2015, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) switched to a more flexible exchange rate policy that provides for minimizing currency interventions in the medium term while limiting the daily volatility of the value of the basket of currencies. To that end, in practice use is made of an operating rule limiting the possibility of National Bankʹs influence on determination of the exchange rate. Currency interventions are, in fact, used to reduce the daily volatility of the exchange rate, and not for regulating its level. In that context, the share accounted for in the basket structure by the Russian ruble has increased to 50%, whereas the shares accounted for by the U.S. dollar and the euro are 30% and 20%, respectively. As a result of the Belarusian rubel tracking a composite, because the exchange rate is not close enough to be classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed. The NBRB does not publish data on its interventions."
2016,124,Belgium,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Belgium participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."

2016,638,Benin,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Benin participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO September 20, 2005."
2016,514,Bhutan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. No current legal documents establish a fixed exchange rate arrangement; the ngultrum has been pegged at par to the Indian rupee since the introduction of the ngultrum in 1974. Under the Royal Monetary Authority Act of Bhutan 2010 (Provisions 88 and 89), the Bhutanese government, on recommendation of the RMA, may declare the external value of the ngultrum, and the RMA will determine the appropriate external value. The RMA does not publish the intervention data."
2016,218,Bolivia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg to the U.S. dollar (also called a “sliding” rate) and is characterized by small exchange rate movements that are not announced in advance. The Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) determines the floor price for the daily competitive foreign exchange auction (“bolsín”) in which the financial private sector and, since 2013, the nonfinancial private sector as well participate. The CBB ensures that the exchange rate is consistent with moderate inflation, thus mitigating external and internal inflationary pressures, since the exchange rate is still used as a benchmark for the prices of nontradable goods, albeit to a decreasing extent due to bolivianization (dedollarization) in real and financial transactions. The exchange rates used in most exchange transactions fluctuate daily within a band of 12 centavos (1.7%), defined by the official buying and selling exchange rates (Bs 6.86 and Bs. 6.96, respectively) plus a margin of one centavo at each end. Because the boliviano stabilized against the U.S. dollar since November 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The authorities consider that the de facto stabilized arrangement does not fully reflect the exchange arrangement managed by the CBB because the official policy of a crawling peg has not changed. The CBBʹs crawling peg mechanism allows the sliding rate to be set at zero without changing the arrangement if the underlying economic fundamentals warrant it. The CBB publishes information on its exchange market interventions and on its foreign exchange purchases and sales in the “Weekly Statistics” section and in other publications such as the Monthly Statistical Bulletin, all of which are available on its website."
2016,963,Bosnia and Herzegovina,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The CB covers base money with its foreign reserves, including currency in circulation and commercial bank deposits. The Law on the Central Bank, adopted by the parliamentary assembly of Bosnia and Herzegovina, guarantees convertibility of the currency of Bosnia and Herzegovina. There are no restrictions on the purchase and sale of foreign exchange. The Central Bank of Bosnia and Herzegovina (CBBH) publishes data on its sales and purchases."
2016,616,Botswana,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as a crawling peg. The official exchange rate of the pula is determined according to a weighted basket of currencies comprising the SDR and the South African rand. The crawl rate is set as the difference between the Bank of Botswanaʹs (BOBʹs) inflation objective and the inflation forecast in major trading partner countries. The crawl rate is thus determined using a forward-looking approach and is revised regularly. In this approach, the authorities periodically determine the crawl rate for the subsequent period, such as the next 6 or 12 months. Effective January 04, 2017,the weights of the basket are 45% for the South African rand and 55% for the SDR, and the crawl rate was set to 0.26%. Previously the BOB set the crawl rate to 0.38% from zero, effective January 04, 2016."
2016,223,Brazil,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. There is no official exchange rate for Brazil as the exchange rate of the real is defined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Brazil (CBB, in Spanish: Banco Central do Brasil or BCB) intervenes to smooth out excessive volatility. Intervention data are available in the CBBʹs weekly publication on currency flows on the CBB website."
2016,516,Brunei Darussalam,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The Autoriti Monetari Brunei Darussalam (AMBD) issues Brunei dollars and manages the Currency Fund, which is used to back up the currency in circulation. Under the Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA), signed in 1967, which remains in effect between the AMBD and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the monetary authorities agree to the mutual exchange of their currency at par without charge. Government authorities and banks must accept each otherʹs currency at par, and the currencies are customary tender in both countries. Excess currency is repatriated regularly, with the cost borne by the currency-issuing authority. The AMBD must ensure that reserves in the Currency Fund cover at least 100% of the currency in circulation as required under the Currency and Monetary (Amendment) Order, 2010. The AMBD publishes data on the reserves used to cover the currency in circulation in its annual report."
2016,918,Bulgaria,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board, which was introduced by the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) of June 1997. The lev was fixed initially to the German mark and subsequently to the euro. The 1997 law was a conceptually new legal act, introducing the currency board mechanism, and cannot be considered an amendment to the previous law of the same name, which was in effect until 1997 and repealed by the new law. Aggregate data for daily euro–lev turnover between the BNB and local banks were published on Reuters page NBOB3 – valid until September 30, 2016. Effective October 3, 2016, the publications on Reuters page NBOB3 have been terminated. Aggregated data for daily euro–lev turnover between the BNB and local banks are published only on the BNB web site, section Statistics/Data for Banking System Liquidity/Forex Operations between BNB and Banks.

2016,618,Burundi,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The new regulations governing the interbank foreign exchange market allow the BRB to intervene on its own initiative. The Burundi franc has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since March 2013. In 2015, the parallel market exchange rate of the Burundi franc deviated significantly from the official exchange rate with a spread of 23% as of end-December 2015. Since June 2016, the exchange rate followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, after an adjustment of about 8% on June 15. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to a crawl-like from a stabilized arrangement, effective June 22, 2016."

Given the high degree of financial dollarization, the National Bank of Cambodia (NBC) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to accommodate demand for riel and maintain exchange rate stability. Since March 2015, the riel has increased its volatility, while still being managed. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed."
2016,622,Cameroon,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. Cameroon participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CEMAC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (Joint Monetary Committee) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to amend the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2016,156,Canada,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating, with the exchange rate of the Canadian dollar determined by supply and demand. However, under an intervention policy established by the government in close consultation with the Bank of Canada (BOC), the BOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market on behalf of the government. The current policy is to intervene on a discretionary, rather than systematic, basis and only in exceptional circumstances. The last time the BOC intervened was as part of the concerted intervention with authorities in Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States to counter an excessively strong yen following the March 2011 earthquake in Japan. Earlier, the BOC intervened in September 1998 to influence movements in the Canadian dollar. Interventions are announced on the BOCʹs website, and the amount of intervention is published in the governmentʹs monthly official press release on international reserves."

2016,228,Chile,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate of the peso currently in effect is freely determined in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Chile (BCCH) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market, in exceptional circumstances, to keep the currency near its equilibrium value in order to avoid costly future reversals. These interventions take the form of transparent, well-founded measures, including explicit definitions of the periods and amounts involved and clearly explained reasons for the intervention. The BCCH usually announces the amount of foreign exchange it intends to buy or sell in its monthly bulletin. It publishes its auction results daily and its reserves weekly. The BCCH has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since 2011."
2016,924,China,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"China officially maintains a de jure managed floating exchange rate arrangement with a view to keeping the RMB exchange rate stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies to preserve the stability of the Chinese economy and financial markets. The floating band of the RMBʹs trading prices is 2% against the U.S. dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market—i.e., on each business day, the trading prices of the RMB against the U.S. dollar in the market may fluctuate within a band of ±2% around the midrate released that day by Chinaʹs Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS). The Peopleʹs Bank of China (PBC) announced that the RMBʹs floating range would be expanded in an orderly manner, based on the developments of the foreign exchange market and economic and financial situation. Banks can determine their quotes of RMB against other currencies based on market demand and their pricing capacity. There is no limit on the purchase and selling prices of spot foreign exchange and cash, which are determined by market supply and demand (PBC No. 2014/188). On August 11, 2015, the PBC decided to further increase the flexibility of the renminbi-to-U.S. dollar exchange rate midrate quoting mechanism, thereby enhancing the market determination of RMB exchange rates, and giving market supply and demand an even greater role in exchange rate formation. Because the RMB followed an appreciating trend within a 2% band against the basket of 13 currencies included in the CFETS index since November 2015, and has stabilized since August 2016, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified twice (1) retroactively to crawl-like from other managed, effective November 11, 2015, and (2) to stabilized from crawl-like, effective August 24, 2016. The CFETS publishes its exchange rate index, and other RMB indices based on the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) currency basket and the SDR currency basket. Effective January 1, 2017, the number of currencies included in the CFETS RMB currency basket was increased from 13 to 24. The new currencies account for about 21% of the new basket and are included as they have become directly traded in the onshore foreign exchange market in 2016. The PBC does not publish its intervention data."
2016,233,Colombia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. All foreign exchange transactions are conducted at the market-determined exchange rate. Effective February 19, 2016, the BR (Banco de la República, Bank of the Republic) further reduced the rate triggering an options auction to 3% in order to mitigate the impact of overreaction of the exchange rate on inflation expectations and to help preserve liquidity conditions in the foreign exchange market. The trigger for holding the auction (RMR (reference market rate) above the moving average of the last 20 business days + 3%) was activated on May 20, 2016. Effective May 27, 2016, the BR announced that it would not hold new options auctions to reduce international reserves and would continue using intervention mechanisms based on their suitability for achieving policy objectives. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement."
2016,632,Comoros,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The Comoros participates in the franc zone area. The Comorian franc is pegged to the euro at the fixed rate of CF 491.96775 per euro; the value of other currencies is based on this fixed rate and on the exchange rates of these currencies in the foreign exchange markets. The exchange rate arrangement is established by the following documents: (1) the monetary November 23, 1979, cooperation agreement between the Comorian and French governments; (2) the November 23, 1998, decision by the European Council of Ministers authorizing France to maintain its monetary arrangements with the CFA area countries and the Comoros; and (3) the January 14, 1999, order of the governor of the Central Bank of Comoros (CBC) on euro–Comorian franc parity. Decree No. 87-005/PR, Regulating Financial Relations between the Comoros and Other Countries and its regulations apply. The government of either the Comoros or France may change the exchange rate arrangement after notification to the other party."
2016,238,Costa Rica,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"On February 2, 2015, under Article 5 of the legal act adopted during session 5677-2015 of the Board of Directors of the Central Bank of Costa Rica (BCCR) held January 30, 2015, a de jure managed float exchange arrangement was established. Under this arrangement: (1) the BCCR allows the exchange rate to be freely determined by foreign currency supply and demand, but it may participate in the market in order to meet its own foreign currency requirements and those of the nonbank public sector (NBPS) and, at its discretion, to prevent sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate; (2) the BCCR may carry out direct operations or use foreign currency trading instruments that it deems appropriate, in accordance with current regulations. In 2016, the colon depreciated by 3.35% and net international reserves declined by US$260 million, mostly as a result of the net foreign exchange needs of the NBPS and the stabilization operations of the BCCR in the Foreign Currency Exchange Market (Monex). In the first half of 2017, dollar buying and selling operations between foreign exchange dealers and the public resulted in a foreign exchange shortfall of US$509 million, which reflects the increased demand for foreign currency by the private sector. The deficit recorded in the first half of 2017 was a response to the increased demand for foreign exchange and averaged US$72.3 million daily (US$63.8 million during the same period of 2016), while the daily supply of dollars was US$68.3 million, US$1.5 million above the average recorded for the same period of the previous year. The main sources of the increased demand for foreign exchange were financial transactions, associated in particular with the dollarization of financial savings and debt payments by the private sector; this effect was compounded by the process of colonization of financial system credit to the private sector. This situation translated into upward pressure on the exchange rate, particularly in the second quarter of the year. Because the exchange rate followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since April 2016, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified from stabilized to a crawl-like arrangement, effective April 26, 2016."
2016,662,Côte dʹIvoire,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Côte dʹIvoire participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO September 20, 2005."
2016,960,Croatia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating without a predetermined path. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) may set intervention exchange rates, which it applies in transactions with banks to limit exchange rate volatility. The CNB conducts foreign exchange auctions on a discretionary basis to ensure the stability of the kuna and provide liquidity for payments domestically and abroad (described under Section H.1.a.3. Auction). Since April 2016, the kuna has stabilized within a 2% band against the euro. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from a crawl-like arrangement, effective April 14, 2016. Intervention data (prices and volume) are published on the CNB website."
2016,354,Curaçao and Sint Maarten,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. Official buying and selling rates for certain other currencies are set daily on the basis of rates of the U.S. dollar abroad. The current peg was established in a national decree on December 24, 1971."
2016,423,Cyprus,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Cyprus participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender.

When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2016,935,Czech Republic,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The external value of the koruna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) might participate. The de facto exchange rate arrangement was classified as a stabilized arrangement, as the CNB automatically intervened in the foreign exchange market in order to maintain its commitment to prevent korunaʹs appreciation against the euro below CZK 27.0 to the euro, and the actual exchange rate remained close to this level during 2016. The exchange rate commitment had been introduced in November 2013 as a further instrument for monetary policy easing at the zero lower bound for nominal interest rates, and discontinued in April 2017. While the koruna has increased its volatility since April 2017, more observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as stabilized. Data on CNBʹs foreign exchange operations are published on the CBʹs web page."
2016,636,Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Congo franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The BCC intervenes through an auction, which is the only operational framework for the BCCʹs transactions with the market. The BCC has intervened on both sides of the market. In 2016, the franc depreciated around 27% with several adjustments and short periods of stability against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from a stabilized arrangement, effective June 21, 2016. Information on foreign exchange market interventions is published on the Internet in the BCC bulletin."
2016,128,Denmark,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The formal framework for the Danish fixed exchange rate policy is the ERM II. Denmark participates in the ERM II with a central rate of DKr 746.038 per €100. The central rate is a conversion of the central rate vis-à-vis the deutsche mark before the third stage of the EMU and was last adjusted in January 1987. Denmark has entered into an agreement with the ECB and the euro area member countries on a narrower fluctuation band of ±2.25%. In recent years, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) has consistently maintained a stable krone within less than 1% of the central rate. The DNʹs net purchase or sale of foreign currency during a month is published at 4:00 p.m. on the second working day of the following month in the Foreign Exchange and Liquidity press release. The agreement on Denmarkʹs fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro within a narrow fluctuation band of ±2.25% around the central rate in ERM II was concluded at an informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council of September 25–27, 1998, in Vienna, between the ministers of economy and finance and the CB governors of the EU member countries."
2016,611,Djibouti,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"Djiboutiʹs monetary system is based on a currency board. The Djibouti franc has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1949, but the legislation establishing the currency board and determining the fixed exchange rate is Law No. 118/AN/11/6ème L of January 22, 2011. The Central Bank of Djibouti (BCD) guarantees and provides for unlimited conversion to U.S. dollars of banknotes and coins used as legal tender in Djibouti. The full issuance of Djibouti francs is covered by foreign exchange reserves. The National Assembly of Djibouti has the authority to make decisions regarding changes in the exchange rate arrangement."
2016,321,Dominica,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Dominica participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2016,243,Dominican Republic,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) aims to increase gradually the flexibility of the exchange rate alongside the implementation of the inflation-targeting framework formally adopted in 2012. The CBDR does not pursue a particular fixed exchange rate level, but rather seeks to manage a pathway around its long-term equilibrium value, consistent with the fundamentals of the Dominican Republic economy and its inflation target. The CBDR intervenes in the foreign exchange market to avoid instances of excessive exchange rate volatility that might affect the inflation target given that the exchange rate pass-through remains high. Since February 2010, the peso has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBDR publishes data on foreign exchange sales and purchases in the foreign exchange market by different institutional actors (financial intermediaries and remittance/foreign exchange agents). The data are published on a gross (all transactions) basis and a net basis (excluding interbank operations). The CBDR does not disclose data on its volume of foreign exchange transactions with financial intermediaries."
2016,248,Ecuador,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an arrangement with no separate legal tender.

The circulation, exchange, withdrawal, and destruction of U.S. dollars, legal tender in Ecuador, are the exclusive domain of the CBE, in accordance with the provisions of this code and the regulation issued by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulation Board. The CBE is required to satisfy demand for liquidity in Ecuador in a timely manner so as to ensure the normal course of economic transactions. To that end, it is authorized to make necessary remittances, which are not deemed imports or exports. Such transactions carried out by the CBE are exempt from all taxes. Electronic currency is placed in circulation exclusively by the CBE, backed by its liquid assets, based on policies and regulations issued by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulation Board. The CBE is the only entity authorized to provide and manage national or electronic metallic currency in Ecuador equivalent and convertible to U.S. dollars, in accordance with the provisions of this code and the regulation and authorization of the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulation Board. The currency referred to is a means of payment and is unrestricted legal tender with unlimited redeemability in Ecuador within the framework of the regulations issued by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulation Board. The government may not require a private individual or legal entity to accept any currency other than the U.S. dollar."
2016,469,Egypt,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Effective November 3, 2016, the Central Bank of Egypt (CBE) announced its decision to move, with immediate effect, to a liberalized exchange rate regime in order to quell any distortions in the domestic foreign currency market. Pursuant to the above, banks and other market participants are at liberty to quote and trade at any exchange rate. Bid and ask exchange rates are determined by forces of demand and supply. The CBE uses the prevailing market rate for any transactions it undertakes. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from other managed. The CBE does not publish intervention data."
2016,253,El Salvador,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. On January 1, 2001, the U.S. dollar became unrestricted legal tender with unlimited redeemability for the settlement of debt in El Salvador. The U.S. dollar is used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange. The Central Reserve Bank (CRB) must exchange colones in circulation for U.S. dollars at banksʹ request at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per U.S. dollar. Both the U.S. dollar and the Salvadoran colón are legal tender; payments may be made in either dollars or colones."
2016,642,Equatorial Guinea,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. Equatorial Guinea participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CEMAC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (Joint Monetary Committee) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to amend the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2016,643,Eritrea,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. Directive No. 1/2005 on the Unified Exchange Rate is the legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement.
2016,939,Estonia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating.

When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2016,644,Ethiopia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. In 2016, the birr followed a depreciating trend vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The NBE publishes the exchange rates and the amount traded in the interbank market on its periodical publications."
2016,819,Fiji,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The Reserve Bank of Fiji (RBF) does not publish intervention data. The power to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is provided in the Reserve Bank of Fiji Act. A change in the exchange rate arrangement may be proposed by the RBF and approved by the minister for finance.

2016,962,Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Under the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Article 33), the denar exchange rate is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. This arrangement is still in place under the current legislation. However, the National Bank of the Republic of Macedonia (NBRM) participates in the foreign exchange market (Article 34), in order to achieve the goals determined with the monetary and the foreign exchange policies. The NBRM is implementing the monetary strategy of targeting the nominal exchange rate against the euro, the intermediary objective of the monetary policy being the maintenance of the denar exchange rate stability. Thus, the NBRM maintains a stable exchange rate within a narrow fluctuation band of bid-ask exchange rates determined by the Committee for Operational Monetary Policy. Size and direction of the interventions are published on a regular quarterly basis, in the Quarterly Report of the NBRM (Balance of Payments section, Financial Account subsection, in the part commenting on the developments of the foreign exchange reserves). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."

2016,915,Georgia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Georgia is floating. The National Bank of Georgia (NBG) intervenes in the foreign exchange market through foreign exchange auctions, but does not make any explicit or implicit commitment with respect to an exchange rate target or path. Foreign exchange sales have been used to limit excessive foreign exchange volatility in the context of significant adverse exogenous shocks. Slow recovery of Georgiaʹs trading partners and weak external demand resulted in a widening trade balance, while tourism and remittances inflows increased. In the second half of 2016, the depreciation of Turkish lira vis-à-vis the dollar and worldwide strengthening of the dollar weakened the lari by 10% in nominal and real effective terms, even though they remained broadly stable, compared to December 2015. In 2016, the NBG sold US$280 million in order to mitigate one-off transaction impact on the exchange rate. It also bought US$278 million back in 2016. In 2017, the NBG sold US$78.7 million to facilitate the loan conversion program. The lari depreciated slightly against the U.S. dollar in 2016 and subsequently appreciated about 7% as of mid-March, 2017. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. The amount sold at the NBGʹs foreign exchange auctions and the average exchange rates are posted on the NBG website shortly after each auction."
2016,134,Germany,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating.

2016,652,Ghana,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the cedi is determined in the market by both interbank foreign exchange activity and foreign exchange bureaus. Ghana joined the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the cedi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within a margin of ±15% around the central rate. However, the authorities have yet to implement these measures. The BOG does not publish information on its interventions. In 2016, the cedi depreciated against the U.S. dollar by 9.65%. The cediʹs weak performance against the U.S. dollar could be attributed to the election uncertainties toward the end of 2016, and to rising unmet foreign exchange demand (corporate demand in the form of trade and maturing LCs). The policy of ceding export proceeds directly to the market since July 2016 did not generate the expected impact."
2016,174,Greece,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating.

2016,328,Grenada,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Grenada participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2016,258,Guatemala,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. In accordance with the Monetary Law and the Free Foreign Exchange Convertibility Law, Guatemala has a flexible exchange rate arrangement under which the rate is determined in the foreign exchange market by supply and demand. However, the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the nominal exchange rate, without affecting its trend. The BOG intervenes through foreign exchange auctions based on a transparent rule, which limits daily volatility. Effective January 1, 2016, the fluctuation margin (added to or subtracted from the five-day moving average of the exchange rate) used to determine whether the BOG may intervene in the foreign exchange market was increased to 0.75% (up from the previous margin of 0.70%). The BOG may also intervene whenever the nominal exchange rate shows unusual volatility. In 2016, the quetzal continued gaining strength and ended the year at GTQ 7.5221/US$ from GTQ 7.6323/US$ when the year began. Purchases of foreign exchange by the CB exceeded US$1 billion, surpassing the combined purchases in the previous three years. However, BOG interventions in the foreign exchange market in 2016 represented only 2.73% of total currencies traded. Intervention data are available on the BOGʹs website."
2016,656,Guinea,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Guinea announced its participation in the exchange rate mechanisms (ERM and ERM II) of the WAMZ, which formally limits the fluctuation of the franc to ±15% around a central rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, but this has yet to be implemented. During 2015, the CBRG intervened once a week through a competitive foreign exchange auction market with commercial banks. However, a structural excess demand of foreign exchange is not reflected in the exchange rate set during the weekly auctions. In practice, the system was a foreign exchange allocation. Commercial banksʹ transactions with their customers were capped within a band of ±4% around the most recent weekly auction rate. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed. The CBRG regularly publishes information regarding foreign exchange market interventions. Effective January 4, 2016, the CBRG replaced the previous weekly foreign exchange allocation with a bi-weekly competitive auction, reflecting market demand for foreign currency. The CBRG adopted an intervention policy based on a budget of foreign exchange sales, and banks were allowed to negotiate freely foreign exchange sales and purchases with their clients. Previously, weekly fluctuation of the reference rate was capped at ±4% of the weekly auction rate. Effective February 1, 2016, with the objective to build up foreign exchange reserves, the CBRG started purchasing foreign exchange directly from foreign exchange bureaus, gold miners, and large corporations."
2016,654,Guinea-Bissau,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Guinea-Bissau participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2016,336,Guyana,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; the exchange rate of the Guyanese dollar is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Guyana (BOG) periodically purchases foreign currency from foreign exchange dealers in order to maintain international reserves at acceptable levels. In accordance with bilateral agreements with the CARICOM CBs, the BOG quotes weekly rates for certain CARICOM currencies. Reflecting the stability of the Guyanese dollar against the U.S. dollar as a result of interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2016,263,Haiti,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to avoid excessive volatility. Following an increased depreciation from June 2016 to March 2017, the gourde appreciated around 2.5% until end-April. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed. The BRH publishes information on foreign exchange interventions weekly on its website."
2016,268,Honduras,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling band. The exchange rate of the lempira is determined by foreign exchange auctions of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). The BCH maintains an operational band requiring all bid prices for the purchase of foreign exchange to be within a range of 7% above or below the base price, with the requirement that bids in auction not exceed 1% of the average base price of the auctions of the preceding seven business days (Resolution No. 271-7/2013 of the BCH). The base price is calculated weekly according to a procedure established by the BCH board of directors for this purpose, which includes the following variables: (1) the differential between the domestic inflation rate and the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners, (2) changes in the exchange rates of these countriesʹ currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and (3) the performance of official reserve assets. The external inflation rate is considered to be the weighted average of the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners. Domestic inflation is measured by the consumer price index. The change in the U.S. dollar exchange rates of the main trading partners is measured using the effective exchange rate index, which is compiled weekly based on the weighted average of the main trading partnersʹ exchange rates expressed in units of their respective currencies to US$1.00. Finally, an adjustment factor is applied to the base price of the auction, depending on the number of months of imports covered by the BCHʹs reserve assets. In July 2011, the BCH (through Resolution No. 284-7/2011 of July 21, 2011) reactivated the crawling band system that had been in operation until mid-2005. As a result, following a long period of stability, the lempira was allowed to crawl once again in July 2011 and thereafter followed a steadily depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar, with a small one-time adjustment in November 2011. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling peg arrangement. The BCH publishes its sales of foreign exchange on its website daily."
2016,532,Hong Kong SAR,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires that the monetary base be backed at least 100% by, and that changes in it be matched 100% by corresponding changes in, the reserve currency (U.S. dollar) at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75–HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—has been in place since May 18, 2005. The monetary base includes issued notes and coins, the balance at the HKMA of banksʹ clearing accounts (i.e., the aggregate balance), and outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Consistent with currency board principles, the HKMA may issue additional Exchange Fund paper when there is an inflow of funds, and the program may expand along with the interest payments on such paper. Issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which back banknotes issued by note-issuing banks (NIBs), must be made against U.S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. Issuance and withdrawal of government-issued notes and coins are settled against U.S. dollars at the same fixed rate. The legal documents that establish the currency board include the Basic Law (Chapter V, Section 1, Articles 110 and 111); the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66); and an exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system under the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The letters specify that the Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system, including the linked exchange rate. Section 3(1) of the ordinance, as amended, specifies that the Exchange Fund “shall be under the control of the Financial Secretary and shall be used primarily for such purposes as the financial secretary thinks fit affecting, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong SAR and for other purposes incidental thereto.” The HKMA is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments, and operational means for doing so, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary system. The HKMA makes immediate announcements of the impact on the aggregate balance due to purchases or sales of U.S. dollars by the Currency Board via various information vendors, including Reuters and Bloomberg. The information is also available on the HKMA website."
2016,944,Hungary,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating because of discretionary intervention by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) in the foreign exchange market. The possible objectives of foreign exchange intervention are listed in the MNBʹs intervention strategy, which has not been published. The strategy aims to avoid disruptive market fluctuations and exchange rate overshooting. However, the strategy emphasizes that the MNB generally refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange market. The MNB converts foreign currency for the government and net current and capital transfers from the EU at market rates. These transactions change the foreign exchange reserve position of the MNB. If the resulting reserve dynamics are not in line with the MNBʹs reserve management objectives, some of the funds are channeled to the market. Transactions are small and conducted at market prices. The MNB announced the policy of channeling the foreign-exchange position resulting from EU transfers several times in the past, most recently in March 2009 for that year. Until 2009, the net amounts were published quarterly in the MNBʹs quarterly and annual reports. The MNB no longer publishes intervention data."
2016,176,Iceland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. In 2016, the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) continued to follow the strategy of increased foreign exchange market intervention as set forth by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in May 2013. CBI transactions accounted for about 55% of total market turnover, broadly the same as in 2015, and the total turnover increased by some 50% year over year. Early in the year, the CBI bought foreign currency with the primary objective of bringing the foreign exchange reserves to the desired size during the prelude to general capital account liberalization. After that objective was achieved, it became more important to mitigate fluctuations in the exchange rate and to prevent overappreciation before taking important steps in the liberalization process. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. The CBI publishes monthly data on its interventions in the foreign exchange market."
2016,534,India,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is largely market determined, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market to manage excessive volatility and maintain orderly conditions without any fixed target or band for the exchange rate. The RBI publishes monthly data on its interventions (foreign exchange purchases and sales) in its monthly bulletin with a six-week lag."
2016,536,Indonesia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating (adopted August 14, 1997). The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Bank Indonesia (BI), however, may intervene—as part of a policy mix—whenever necessary to achieve the inflation target and to maintain macroeconomic stability. When it intervenes, the BI does not target a specific rate or maintain exchange rate movements within a specific band; rather it provides liquidity to maintain market stability. The BI does not disclose data on its interventions. Since August 2013, the rupiah has moved more freely. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement."
2016,433,Iraq,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as a conventional peg arrangement. The Central Bank Law gives the Board of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) the authority to formulate exchange rate policy, and the board has maintained its policy to keep the official exchange rate at ID 1,180/82 (bid-ask) per U.S. dollar since December 1, 2015. Effective January 1, 2016, the CBI set the cash and transfer exchange rate at ID 1,182 + 8 (fees) = 1,190 per U.S. dollar and, effective January 2, 2017, the exchange rate was set at ID 1,184 + 6 (fees) = 1,190 per U.S. dollar. The CBI provides foreign exchange at the official exchange rate plus commissions for permissible transactions through its daily auctions (allocations), establishing a peg. However, because certain transactions are excluded from access to the CBI auctions, many transactions take place at parallel market exchange rates. The CBI publishes the daily volume of the auction allocation on its website."
2016,178,Ireland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Ireland participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2016,429,Islamic Republic of Iran,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a managed floating arrangement against a basket of currencies since 2002. From September 2012 to July 2013, the rial traded at three different rates—an official appreciated rate for imports of priority goods, a second official rate for the sale of oil export receipts and imports of other essential goods, and a flexible bureau rate for the sale of non-oil exports and imports of all remaining goods. The authorities unified the two official exchange rates at the more depreciated rate in July 2013. The premium between the official rate and the parallel market rate is currently at about 15%. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2016,436,Israel,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the Bank of Israel (BOI) announced in August 2009 that it would intervene in the foreign exchange market in the event of unusual movements in the exchange rate that are inconsistent with underlying economic conditions or when conditions in the foreign exchange market are disorderly. The BOI did not intervene in the foreign exchange market from August 2011 through March 2013. In April 2013, the BOI intervened again in the foreign exchange market in line with the foreign exchange policy announced in August 2009. In May 2013, the BOI announced a multiyear foreign exchange purchase plan to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate. The BOI purchased US$6.04 billion in the foreign exchange market during 2016 (US$8.77 billion in 2015 and US$7.00 billion in 2014), of which US$1.80 billion (US$3.10 billion in 2015 and US$3.50 billion in 2014) was part of the purchase plan to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate and the rest was under the foreign exchange policy announced in August 2009. The BOI announced, on November 14, 2016, that it will purchase US$1.5 billion in 2017 in the foreign exchange market to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. The BOI publishes monthly purchase information."
2016,136,Italy,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Italy participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2016,343,Jamaica,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market, in which the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) intervenes occasionally with sales and purchases of foreign currency. Given the pattern of the exchange rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BOJ publishes information on its interventions in its Annual Report and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report."
2016,158,Japan,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the yen is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disorderly conditions in the market. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Interventions fall within the mandate of the MOF, which publishes daily purchases and sales amounts as well as intervention currencies on its website. The Bank of Japan (BOJ), acting as agent of the minister of finance, intervenes in the market through financial institutions and/or brokers. The last time the MOF intervened in the foreign exchange market was from October 31 through November 4, 2011 (¥9,091.6 billion) to address excess volatility and disorderly exchange rate movement. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating."
2016,439,Jordan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dinar is officially pegged to the SDR, but in practice, it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since late 1995. The CBJ is responsible for maintaining the stability of the dinar exchange rate."
2016,916,Kazakhstan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"On August 20, 2015, the National Bank and the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan announced the transition to a de jure free floating exchange rate arrangement for the tenge. Participation by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) in currency trading was not systematic during 2016 and it was dictated exclusively by the need to smooth out sharp destabilizing fluctuations. The exchange rate of the tenge fluctuated between 327.66 and 383.91 tenge to the U.S. dollar. The greatest volatility in the tenge exchange rate was seen at the beginning of the year. In connection with the gradual rise in oil prices, no significant volatility in the exchange rate was seen after February 2016. In the first half of 2016, in connection with a shift in currency preferences among market participants and the public, there was a high demand for tenge in the foreign exchange market, as a result of which the supply of foreign currency exceeded demand by a significant margin. With the aim of mitigating the risks associated with a steep strengthening of the domestic currency, the NBK stepped in as a buyer of foreign currency. At end-June 2016, the exchange rate of the tenge in the market had weakened by 0.4% since the beginning of the year and was equal to 338.66 tenge to the U.S. dollar. In July 2016, the market exchange rate of the tenge had weakened by 4.0% and was equal to 352.25 tenge to the U.S. dollar. While there was a rise in world oil prices in the first half of 2016, the trend shifted in July 2016. Oil prices began to fall steadily and dropped by 14.5% in July (from US$49.7 to US$42.5). Operations by the NBK in the foreign exchange market in July 2016 were aimed at limiting a significant change in the exchange rate. In August 2016, the situation in the foreign exchange market stabilized and was characterized by a balance between foreign currency supply and demand. From September through the end of 2016, the situation in the foreign exchange market remained stable. The exchange rate of the tenge fluctuated between 328.91 and 344.56 tenge to the U.S. dollar. At the end of the year, the exchange rate of the tenge strengthened by 2.0% and was equal to 333.29 tenge to the U.S. dollar. The NBK performed no interventions in the foreign exchange market during the four months from September through December 2016. The NBK started publishing monthly data on foreign exchange interventions on a regular basis from 2016. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2016,664,Kenya,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. Official foreign exchange market interventions aim to moderate the rate of change and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than to establish a particular level. Data on interventions are only partially disclosed. If the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) uses the auction system to intervene, the market is informed of the amount dealt and the average rate. (The average rate is published after the auction closes.) If the CBK chooses to intervene directly (i.e., by buying or selling foreign exchange from or to banks directly through the Reuters Dealing System), the market is informed but amounts and rates are not published. Since November 2015, the Kenyan shilling has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, following the normalization of market conditions with frequent CBK intervention on both sides of the market. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to stabilized from a floating arrangement, effective November 4, 2015."
2016,826,Kiribati,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. There is no central monetary institution, and the authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange. The Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Bank (Kiribati) Limited, the only commercial bank, quotes daily rates for 15 currencies on the basis of their respective rates against the Australian dollar."
2016,542,Korea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the won is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. As such, the system is managed in accordance with the principles defined by the free floating system, and the governmentʹs role is very limited to remain within the range allowed by the free floating system. However, because of the lack of information on the authoritiesʹ interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Korea (BOK) may intervene in the market with the funds of the BOK and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund when it is deemed necessary for the stability of the market. Interventions in the spot market or through derivatives in the forward market are not announced, and intervention data are not published."
2016,967,Kosovo,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The euro is legal tender and circulates freely.
2016,443,Kuwait,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. According to the law of the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK), the exchange rate arrangement is specified by an “amiri” decree in consultation with the governor of the CBK (see CBK Law, Chapter I, Article II). The arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. Intervention data are not disclosed to the public."
2016,917,Kyrgyz Republic,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The NBKR may participate in the interbank foreign exchange market and when necessary it may take measures to smooth out excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate. In 2016, the som appreciated around 12% against the U.S. dollar by end-July, after which it remained relatively stable until end-April 2017. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2016,544,Lao P.D.R.,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,The de jure exchange arrangement is a managed float. Since January 2015 the kip has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement.
2016,941,Latvia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Latvia participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2016,446,Lebanon,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is free floating. In practice, the exchange rate remains within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (LL 1,501–1,515/U.S. dollar). Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Banque du Liban (BDL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market daily from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and from 10:00 a.m. until noon on Friday. The BDL does not publish intervention data."

2016,674,Madagascar,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the official interbank market. The Central Bank of Madagascar (CBM) intervenes in the interbank market to smooth large exchange rate fluctuations and meet foreign reserve targets. Information on CBM daily interventions is not publicly available. Only the weighted average daily rate and the number and amount of transactions are made available to the public through the CBM official site. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. In 2016, the ariary depreciated by 0.34% against the euro and by 4.65% against the US dollar. Excess supply was observed in the market essentially as a result of export revenue inflows from the vanilla sector starting in mid-June. There was significant buying by the CBM amounting to a total of $311 million. The CBM publishes its interventions (1) daily and only in terms of volume through the interbank foreign exchange market (MID) for participating banks, (2) daily and weekly by courier to the Ministry of Finance and Budget and the Presidency, and (3) weekly by mail to the IMF Resident Representative in Madagascar."
2016,676,Malawi,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Official intervention focuses on building foreign reserves and limiting exchange rate volatility while taking into account seasonal fluctuations. Since August 2016, the kwacha has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from floating, effective August 3, 2016. The de facto methodology for classification of exchange rate regimes is based on a backward-looking statistical approach that relies on past exchange rate movement and historical data. Therefore, this reclassification does not imply statements or views on future or intended policies nor does it imply a policy commitment on the part of the country authorities."
2016,548,Malaysia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) operates a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement. On September 26, 2016, BNM affirmed that market forces determine the direction and level of the exchange rate. Intervention in the market is limited to providing liquidity to ensure orderly market conditions. Previously, the BNM managed the exchange rate with reference to a currency basket. The ringgit has adjusted to reflect changes in the global economy including the developments in the U.S. economy. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from other managed, effective September 26, 2016."
2016,556,Maldives,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Since 2011, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. This regime allows the rufiyaa to float within a 20% band around a central parity of Rf 12.85 per U.S. dollar. However, the rufiyaa remained stabilized in a narrow band against the U.S. dollar near the ceiling of the band (Rf 15.42 per U.S. dollar). Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Under the Maldives Monetary Authority Act, the president may decide to change the exchange rate arrangement and adjust the exchange rate."
2016,678,Mali,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Mali participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO September 20, 2005."

2016,682,Mauritania,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The ouguiya was previously de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar, at an exchange rate of UM 268.6 per U.S. dollar (October 24, 2005, through January 25, 2007). Since 2007, the new foreign exchange market uses a fixing system in which the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) intervenes. The BCM intervenes in order to regulate the exchange market according to its exchange rate policy objectives (smoothing the exchange rate and the projected level of official reserves). Since September 2014, the ouguiya has followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. A summary statement of market turnover data is updated daily on the BCM website."
2016,684,Mauritius,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand forces in the domestic foreign exchange market. Interventions by the BOM in the foreign exchange market are limited to smoothing volatility and do not aim to offset market forces. Information regarding interventions is published regularly on the BOM website and in its publications.
2016,273,Mexico,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating; the exchange rate of the peso is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Foreign Exchange Commission (FEC), comprised of members of the CB and the MOF, determines the foreign exchange rate policy. In the past, Mexico implemented rule-based mechanisms to provide liquidity and promote the sound functioning of the foreign exchange market, as well as to cope with market volatility. The FEC does not target or defend any exchange rate level. These mechanisms were designed to work as an assurance to market participants, and the daily amount used was limited compared to the volume traded of the Mexican peso in the market. Effective February 17, 2016, the FEC announced that they would immediately stop all rule-based and regular auctions, and instead rely on discretionary intervention only under extraordinary and unusual circumstances. However, this has occurred only once as of April 30, 2016. All past auction results are publicly available. Effective February 21, 2017, the Foreign Exchange Commission announced a new foreign exchange hedging program, with the Central Bank of Mexico able to offer up to US$20 billion of non-deliverable forwards with a maturity of up to 12 months and settled in pesos. A first auction of US$1billion was completed on March 6, 2017."
2016,868,Micronesia,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Micronesia is the U.S. dollar. The authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange.
2016,921,Moldova,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The National Bank of Moldova (NBM) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the leu against the U.S. dollar. Sharp fluctuations are not specifically defined; however, the NBM intervenes based on market conditions and future expectations of market participants. These interventions do not aim to change the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM intervenes directly at the market-quoted rates and publishes aggregated monthly data on its website regarding its interventions and interbank market turnover. The data show interventions by currency and type of operation (spot or derivative)."
2016,948,Mongolia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The BOM reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The BOM intervenes through the auction to moderate the rate of change in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. The BOM publishes the cut-off rate for each auction on its website.

2016,686,Morocco,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a composite. Since April 2001, the basket has been composed of the euro and the U.S. dollar, with weights of 60% and 40%, respectively, as of April 2015. The Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) publishes its monthly foreign exchange purchases and sales on its website. The authority to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is found in Dahir No. 1-05-38 of November 23, 2005, promulgating Law No. 76-03 establishing the charter of the BAM (Chapter II, Missions, Section I, Core missions, Article 8). The exchange arrangement falls within the purview and prerogatives of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The BAM is responsible for its operational implementation (quoted rates, ranges) and any changes and monitors the foreign exchange market."
2016,688,Mozambique,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Both the de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. As a major conduit for foreign aid flows, the Bank of Mozambique (BM) is the main channel for foreign exchange into the market. It also intervenes to smooth seasonal fluctuations. For its transactions in Mozambiqueʹs interbank foreign exchange market (MCI) the BM uses the quotes shown on the screen for each commercial bank. The BM is therefore a price taker—i.e., it takes the highest foreign exchange selling rate and the lowest buying rate. The BM publishes information on its website regarding foreign exchange transactions in the MCI. It also publishes the schedule of MCI benchmark average exchange rates in the Jornal Notícias and on its website."
2016,518,Myanmar,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. In April 2012, the CBM started daily two-way multiple price foreign currency auctions, which provide a mechanism for the market to determine an exchange rate the CBM can use to set its new reference rate. However, the CBM reserves the right to intervene periodically to mitigate undue exchange rate volatility and support the liquidity of the kyat in the foreign exchange market. The CBM has no predetermined target for the level of the kyat exchange rate or its trading range and expects the value to fluctuate with supply and demand in the market. The CBM has widened the trading band in the wholesale market and retail market within ±0.8% of the CBM reference rate. Beginning in October 2014, the CBM attempted to slow kyat depreciation by setting its reference rate at a more appreciated rate than the parallel market rate, which increased the spread between the two rates significantly. The spread between the reference rate and market rate averaged 6.3% in June 2015. The spread then narrowed to generally below 2% until late 2016, when it increased and peaked at 4.6% on December 15, 2016, before returning to less than 2% by the end of December 2016. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed."
2016,728,Namibia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement is the CMA agreement.
2016,558,Nepal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. The Nepal Rastra Bank (NRB) is designated as the agency that may decide on changes in the exchange rate system.

When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2016,196,New Zealand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may intervene if the exchange rate is exceptionally high or low, if that rate is not justified by economic fundamentals, and if there is a material prospect that the intervention will influence the exchange rate. Interventions may not be used as an attempt to influence the long-term trend of the exchange rate. The RBNZ publishes information on its foreign currency assets and liabilities, including its foreign currency intervention capacity (stock of reserves available for intervention) and foreign exchange swap position, on its website but does not publish data on its direct intervention. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2016,278,Nicaragua,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg. The Central Bank of Nicaragua (BCN) publishes aggregated monthly data pertaining to BCN foreign exchange transactions with the banks and the government.

2016,694,Nigeria,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, with the CBN beginning operations on a flexible exchange rate regime on June 20, 2016. The CBN explicitly aims to maintain an exchange rate principally driven by market forces, but intervenes to reduce volatility and to counteract speculative attacks on the national currency. In 2016, the naira was stable against the U.S. dollar until June, when the official rate depreciated by about 55% before stabilizing anew since August. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate has been reclassified twice: first to other managed from stabilized, effective June 21, 2016, and then to stabilized from other managed, effective August 26, 2016. The CBN publishes information on the amount of foreign exchange it supplies to the Inter-Bank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) on its website while the banks are required to publish the utilization in the national newspapers. Nigeria participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires maintaining the spot exchange rate between the naira and the U.S. dollar within ±15% of the central rate, but the CBN has not implemented this regime."
2016,142,Norway,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as free floating; the krone floats freely and independently against other currencies. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Norges Bank (NB) does not normally intervene to influence the exchange rate of the krone; however, it may intervene in the foreign exchange market on short notice if the krone deviates substantially from the level the NB considers reasonable in relation to fundamentals and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target. The NB may also intervene in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level. The NB has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999. Foreign exchange purchases or sales for the Government Pension Fund Global are publicly preannounced on the CB website. In extraordinary circumstances, the NB may provide foreign exchange liquidity via collateralized operations. This was done between September 2008 and July 2009."
2016,449,Oman,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg to the U.S. dollar. According to the Banking Law of 1974, later amended by Royal Decree No. 114/2000, the par value of the rial is determined from time to time by His Majesty The Sultan."
2016,564,Pakistan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The State Bank of Pakistan (SBP) does not explicitly or implicitly commit to an exchange rate target or path. Since March 2015, the exchange rate has stabilized against the U.S. dollar, with one realignment in August 2015. Due to limited exchange rate volatility, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to stabilized from other managed, effective March 4, 2015. The de facto methodology for classification of exchange rate regimes is based on a backward-looking statistical approach that relies on past exchange rate movement and historical data. Therefore, this reclassification does not imply statements or views on future or intended policies nor does it imply a policy commitment on the part of the country authorities. The SBP does not publish information on its intervention."

The exchange rate of the kina is determined in the interbank market, in which ADs participate. The BPNG intervenes in the foreign exchange market to smooth extreme fluctuations; however, it does not publish information on its interventions. On June 4, 2014, the BPNG introduced an exchange rate trading margin with a kina buying rate within 75 basis points (bps) above the interbank midrate and a kina selling rate within 75 bps below the midrate. Since May 2016, the exchange rate has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar.

2016,288,Paraguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand. The objective of the Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) under Article 3 of Law No. 489/95 is to preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the CBP aims to smooth seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. The CBP intervenes occasionally in the market to smooth the effects of undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. The CBP, as the governmentʹs financial agent, receives U.S. dollars from the government by way of royalties and compensation paid by the binational hydroelectric entities and exchanges them for guaraníes at the request of the government for the purpose of public expenditures. These dollars from the public sector are returned to the market through programmed sales. Accordingly, in July 2013, the CBP implemented a program of preannounced sales of the U.S. dollars it purchases from the government. This program indicates in advance the nature, frequency, and size of the CBPʹs foreign exchange transactions to avoid influencing market expectations of the exchange rate. Actions of the CBP in the exchange market are announced in advance. However, the CBP may deviate from the program of preannounced sales at any time. Data on CBP operations in the market, whether in the form of programmed or supplementary foreign exchange transactions, are updated weekly on the CBPʹs website."
2016,293,Peru,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Peru has a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility without altering the exchange rate trend. BCRP interventions can also be conducted through dollar-indexed bonds and foreign exchange swaps. Spot intervention in 2016 amounted to net purchases of US$0.8 billion. The sol depreciated in early 2016, but subsequently appreciated, with a total appreciation against the US$ by 1.7% in 2016 (from 3.41 to 3.36 per dollar). In January–July 2017, the sol appreciated a further 3.4%. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The BCRP publishes daily information about its intervention operations (prices and amounts) on its website."
2016,566,Philippines,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) adheres to a market-determined exchange rate policy with some scope for occasional action solely to prevent potentially disruptive sharp fluctuations. The BSP does not target or support a given level of exchange rate; it allows the value of the peso to be determined by supply and demand. The BSP may participate in the U.S. dollar–peso market directly with market participants or via market makers and does not disclose intervention data, which are for internal use only. Data on currency swaps settled in foreign currency and non-deliverable forwards settled in domestic currency are reported monthly in Sections II and IV, respectively, of the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which is posted on the BSP website. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2016,964,Poland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the zloty is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, and the zloty is traded freely against all currencies. Narodowy Bank Polski (NBP, National Bank of Poland), however, may intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary to ensure domestic macroeconomic and financial stability. The NBP does not disclose its intervention data. Given that NBP intervened in the foreign exchange market last time in 2013 (the only intervention in that year), the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. The NBP did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2016. In addition, the MOF has continued the sale of foreign currency funds partially in the foreign exchange market (sale of foreign currency funds in the CB was also used)."

The targeted peg was officially authorized by Amiri Decree No. 34 of 2001 issued in July 2001, replacing the de jure exchange rate policy of pegging to the SDR, which had been in effect since 1975. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) does not publish data on its interventions."
2016,634,Republic of Congo (Congo),973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Central African Monetary Union (CAMU) is a conventional peg. The Republic of Congo participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CEMAC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (Joint Monetary Committee) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to amend the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2016,968,Romania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) may intervene to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations. There is no formal definition of excessive exchange rate fluctuations: the assessment is based on domestic and international market circumstances and on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The NBR intervenes either directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers. The NBR does not publish information on its interventions. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement.
2016,922,Russia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"As of November 10, 2014, the Bank of Russia (BR) eliminated the operational band for the values of the dual currency basket (0.55 U.S. dollar + 0.45 euro) and regular foreign exchange interventions on the borders of this band and outside the band, adopting a de jure free floating exchange rate arrangement. Under this arrangement, the exchange rate of the ruble is determined by market factors. Following the transition to the free floating exchange rate arrangement, the BR retained the ability to intervene in the domestic foreign exchange market in the event of threats to financial stability. In order to maintain the stability of the domestic foreign exchange market and to ensure that Russian credit and nonfinancial institutions can continue servicing external debt despite international financial sanctions and a reduction in foreign exchange earnings from exports due to the decline in world oil prices, since the second half of 2014 the BR has also been supplying Russian credit institutions with foreign currency on the condition that it be repaid, through one-day foreign exchange swap transactions involving the sale of U.S. dollars for rubles; through 1-week, 28-day, and 12-month repo operations; and through loans in foreign currency with 28-day and 365-day maturities (the performance of 12-month repo operations in foreign currency was suspended by the BR, effective April 1, 2016). This debt has been reduced and it is expected to be paid off by end-2017. In addition, the BR may perform foreign exchange purchases to increase the volume of international reserves to US$500 billion. To do this, the BR may purchase foreign currency in the domestic foreign exchange market, depending on the actual exchange rate of the ruble or certain conditions governing the functioning of the domestic foreign exchange market. Operations are performed in small volumes on a uniform basis throughout the day, so as not to influence the intraday dynamics of the rubleʹs exchange rate. BR Information about the frequency and volumes of the BRʹs foreign currency interventions is posted on the BRʹs website under the “Liquidity of the banking sector and monetary policy instruments” subsection of the “Statistics” section. The moderately tight monetary policy being pursued by the BR, as well as the use of instruments to supply credit institutions with foreign currency with repayment obligation, helped to stabilize the situation in the domestic foreign exchange market following the confidence shock experienced at the end of 2014. However, instability in the world oil market and the expectation of a rise in the key rate by the U.S. Federal Reserve put depreciation pressure on the domestic foreign exchange market throughout most of 2015. From spring 2016 to mid-2017, the rubleʹs exchange rate depicted an upward trend. The de facto exchange arrangement is classified as free floating. Effective February 1, 2017, the MOF implemented a new mechanism of foreign exchange purchases and sales to enhance the stability and predictability of local economic conditions and to reduce the impact of price volatility in the global energy market on Russiaʹs economy and public finance. Trade volumes will depend on the amount of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget. As long as the actual Urals price exceeds US$40/bbl2, MOF will be purchasing foreign exchange in the amount of additional oil and gas revenues. If the actual prices drop below this level, MOF will be selling foreign exchange in the amount of the resulting shortfall of oil and gas revenues. The cumulative (from the beginning of operations) foreign exchange sales volumes should not exceed the cumulative purchase volumes. The size of these operations will be announced at the start of every month and purchases will be evenly distributed within the month. The foreign exchange purchase program is preannounced, predictable, involves small daily amounts, and is not triggered by an exchange rate level."
2016,714,Rwanda,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has intervened directly in order to prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Since March 2015, the exchange rate has followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to a crawl-like arrangement from other managed, effective March 4, 2015. The BNR discloses its data on its interventions on the market."
2016,862,Samoa,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) does not publish data on its interventions. Currently, there is no legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement, except the CBS Act of 2015, which states only that the CBS is responsible for setting the exchange rate."
2016,135,San Marino,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. On March 27, 2012, San Marino signed a monetary agreement with the EU repealing the previous monetary agreement of November 29, 2000. The agreement authorizes San Marino to use the euro as its official currency, grant legal tender status to euro banknotes and coins, and issue limited quantities of euro coins. San Marino is committed to adopting the relevant EU legislation (on euro banknotes and coins; combating fraud and counterfeiting; banking and financial legislation, including the prevention of money-laundering and statistical reporting requirements) within the time specified by that agreement. The list of legal acts to be implemented and the time limits for their transposition are reviewed each year by a “Joint Committee” as provided for by Articles 8 and 11 of the Monetary Agreement."
2016,716,São Tomé and Príncipe,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg against the euro. Beginning February 1, 2009, the focus of the BCSTP switched from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which became the new reference currency for the peg on January 1, 2010. The Organic Law of the BCSTP authorizes it to make decisions regarding exchange rate policy."
2016,456,Saudi Arabia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rate of the riyal against the U.S. dollar is determined by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) and has been stable since June 1986. The SAMA, in coordination with the minister of finance, decides on changes in the exchange rate arrangement. Historically, the SAMA has not published its intervention data."
2016,722,Senegal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Senegal participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2016,942,Serbia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"In accordance with the revised IMF classification system of exchange rate arrangements, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The current Decision on the Dinar Exchange Rate Regime stipulates “managed floating.” Since the introduction of this exchange rate regime in 2001 and in accordance with its commitment to liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has tried to reduce its participation in the foreign exchange market and to adjust the features of the existing exchange rate regime in the direction of soft managed floating. This exchange rate regime enables the NBS to balance, when necessary, foreign exchange demand and supply and moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate in either direction (appreciation or depreciation) that may occur under the influence of external or internal shocks to the national economy. Because the NBSʹs intervention policy contributed to the stabilization of the dinar within a 2% band against the euro during 2016, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from floating, effective January 28, 2016. The de facto methodology for classification of exchange rate regimes is based on a backward-looking statistical approach that relies on past exchange rate movement and historical data. Therefore, this reclassification does not imply statements or views on future or intended policies nor does it imply a policy commitment on the part of the country authorities."
2016,718,Seychelles,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand in the market. The CBS intervenes only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility. The CBS occasionally participates in the foreign exchange market for reserve accumulation. Operational guidelines designate the CBS as the buyer and seller of last resort in the foreign exchange market. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The CBS discloses intervention data on its website, which is publicly accessible. The Seychelles rupee on average was on an overall depreciating trend vis-à-vis the major international currencies in 2016, except against the British pound sterling (GBP) against which the domestic currency appreciated in the aftermath of the Brexit referendum in the UK in June 2016. Developments in the exchange rate were attributed to both domestic and external factors. On the domestic front, a stronger tourism performance (both in terms of higher arrivals and spending) was observed in 2016 as compared to 2015. There was however a strong demand for foreign exchange in the economy putting a depreciating pressure on the Seychelles rupee. During 2016, the CBS intervened in the foreign exchange market for reserves accumulation purposes and purchased a total of US$21 million. On the external front, despite an improved performance in exports and the overall lower international commodity prices, a higher demand for manufactured goods imports resulted in a worsening of the countryʹs trade balance. The strengthening of the U.S. dollar on the international markets supported by the steady economic recovery in the US also contributed to the depreciation of the Seychelles rupee against the U.S. dollar."
2016,724,Sierra Leone,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is floating, as the exchange rate of the leone is market determined. The BSL does not target a specific level of the exchange rate. Occasionally, it buys or sells foreign exchange in the market to build up its reserves and sells to the market as part of its open market operations through the foreign exchange auction. The foreign exchange auction data is published on the BSL website. In 2016, the leone has depreciated about 28.73%, while being managed. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified retroactively to other managed from floating, effective August 10, 2015."
2016,576,Singapore,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. The authorities manage the exchange rate as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the objective of maintaining price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. The Singapore dollar is allowed to fluctuate within a targeted policy band and is managed against a basket of currencies of the countryʹs major trading partners and competitors. Currencies in the basket are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the countries in Singaporeʹs trade relations with the world. The exchange rate policy is announced every six months in the Monetary Policy Statement, typically in terms of changes to the slope, central rate, and width of the policy band. In response to changing macroeconomic conditions, the policy parameters may also be adjusted outside the regular biannual cycle. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. In 2016, the Singapore dollar remained stable within a 2% band against a currency composite. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) intervenes through agents and does not publish information on its interventions."
2016,936,Slovak Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. The Slovak Republic participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2016,961,Slovenia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Slovenia participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender.

When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2016,813,Solomon Islands,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime pegs the Solomon Islands dollar (SBD) to a basket of currencies. The policy aims to ensure price stability and maintain a managed exchange rate policy in line with economic fundamentals and offer some flexibility. In May 2014, the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) revised the exchange rate management policy that modifies the exchange rate formula applied to implement the exchange rate policy pegging the SBD to an invoice-weighted basket of currencies. The aim was to (1) ensure that daily management of the exchange rate follows the basket peg more closely to achieve a constant and stable exchange rate; (2) ensure that the currency peg does not lead to real exchange rate misalignment (overvaluation, etc.) in the presence of inflation differentials with the Solomon Islandsʹ trading partners; and (3) review the merits of widening the current band of ±1% to ±1.5% around the base parity of the bilateral (SBD–U.S. dollar) exchange rate in order to benefit more fully from the advantages of a basket peg. The SBD per U.S. dollar value is the value of the index multiplied by the SBD per U.S. dollar value on the day the basket peg was introduced. The exchange rate (midrate) is now expressed in SBDs per U.S. dollar and is determined by the total index of the basket multiplied by the initial base rate expressed in SBDs rather than U.S. dollars, as was done previously. The midrate is announced as the official rate. The bank removed the band ?1% and +1% in October 2014 to allow greater flexibility in the basket movements. The bank maintained its exchange rate policy of pegging against the basket of currency index after removal of the band and allows intervention to the basket when necessary."
2016,726,Somalia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The currency of Somalia is the Somali shilling (SOS). However, the de facto currency is the U.S. dollar. Dollar banknotes are used as cash currency with Somali banknotes serving as a sub-denomination. Mobile phone payments, with transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, are widely used. Most transactions are settled in U.S. dollars. Neighboring country currencies are also used in border areas. From December 2014 to March 2016, the SOS/U.S. dollar exchange rate depreciated by 12.4%, mostly owing to an influx of new counterfeit notes. Since April 2016, the SOS/U.S. dollar exchange rate has remained stable (at about SOS 23,000 per U.S. dollar). The de jure exchange rate arrangement is undetermined. Due to the absence of administrative measures controlling the level of the exchange rate, and the inoperative status of the CBS in the foreign exchange market, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a free floating arrangement."
2016,199,South Africa,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free-floating. The exchange rate of the rand is determined by market forces (i.e., demand and supply) in the foreign exchange market. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has a publicly announced foreign exchange policy of purchasing foreign currency in the local foreign exchange market when market conditions permit. The main objective for conducting spot purchases is to accumulate foreign exchange reserves. However, in certain exceptional cases, the SARBʹs involvement in the spot market is aimed at facilitating the smooth functioning of interbank foreign exchange market, e.g., when there are relatively large foreign direct inflows into the country. In implementing its foreign exchange policy, the SARB does not seek to influence the level of the exchange rate. The SARB interacts with ADs as the price taker for official and commercial purposes. The market makers and brokers quote prices to other market participants; the SARB does not quote prices for market participants. The SARB publishes the official gold and foreign exchange reserves on a monthly basis including a statement explaining aggregate changes in reserves. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2016,733,South Sudan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"In mid-December 2015, the authorities introduced a de jure floating exchange rate regime, which led to an 84% depreciation of the exchange rate. Under the new regime, the Bank of South Sudan (BSS) supplies foreign exchange to commercial banks in auctions, and an indicative market rate is determined from the auction rate and the rate charged by commercial banks. All government transactions are carried out using the indicative market rate. The reform was successful in reducing the spread between the official/indicative and parallel exchange rates. The reform also included abolishing of exchange controls. However, excessive expansionary monetary policy has continued to exert downward pressure on the exchange rate and undermined convergence of the official and parallel rates. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed."
2016,184,Spain,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Spain participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2016,524,Sri Lanka,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating since its introduction by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on January 23, 2001. The external value of the Sri Lankan rupee continued to depreciate in 2016. The Sri Lankan rupee, which depreciated by 0.82% in the first half of the year, depreciated at a higher rate of 3.04% in the second half. The relatively low depreciation of the rupee in the first half was supported by the supply of foreign exchange liquidity by the CB, amounting to US$1,093 million, on a net basis. However, the rupee depreciated at a higher rate with the curtailment in intervention by the CB with a net absorption of US$325 million during the second half of the year. A substantial amount of the foreign exchange supplied during the second half was to partially ease the pressure arising due to the disinvestment by nonresident investors in the government securities market, particularly during the last quarter of the year. This outflow from the government securities market was driven by the expectation and the subsequent increase in interest rates by the US Federal Reserve Bank. Throughout the year, with these developments, the rupee depreciated by 3.83% against the dollar from SL Rs 144.06 as at end-2015, to Rs 149.80 as at end-2016. In addition, the annual average exchange rate depreciated by 6.64% to SL Rs 145.60 against the dollar in 2016. This trend of depreciation was consistent to some extent with the demand and supply conditions in the domestic foreign exchange market as the modest levels of inflows with the decline in exports of goods and the moderate growth in workersʹ remittances were insufficient to meet the demand arising from higher imports and foreign debt service payments. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2016,361,St. Kitts and Nevis,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Kitts and Nevis participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2016,362,St. Lucia,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Lucia participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar under a currency board arrangement at EC$2.70 per U.S. dollar. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."

2016,732,Sudan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating. MFR used by commercial banks is determined in the interbank market, in which participants deal directly with each other. The CBOS participates in the market through swaps under a rules-based mechanism that triggers intervention if the exchange rate exceeds a band of ±4% around the previous dayʹs closing rate. The main objective of the policy is exchange rate stability. Sudanʹs multiple exchange rate regime includes (1) a CB rate that also applies to payment of government obligations and customs valuation. The rate of customs valuation is revised daily but not necessarily at CBOS rate; (2) a gold exchange rate used by the CBOS for gold transactions; and (3) an MFR used mainly by commercial banks and exchange bureaus. The MFR applies to all other transactions and has two components: (1) an indicative rate; and (2) a flexibility factor that allows banks to deviate from the average of the indicative rate and the incentive by a range of ±4%. The rate for collecting customs revenue changes daily. In 2016, the official exchange rate was adjusted by 8.24%. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The CBOS does not disclose information on its interventions to the public."
2016,366,Suriname,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. In accordance with a July 1994 presidential decree, the exchange rate is determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange. In February 6, 2016, the Central Bank of Suriname (Centrale Bank van Suriname, CBvS) announced that it would start conducting a weekly foreign exchange auction with commercial banks. Effective March 22, 2016, the authorities floated the currency based on a system of foreign exchange auctions aimed at ensuring a convergence of the official exchange rate to the market rate. Effective May 10, 2016, the CBvS authorized commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus to freely determine exchange rates. At the same time, the exchange rate has been marked by periods of stability, most notably during June–August 2016 and from December 2016 onwards, with shorter periods of fluctuations. The de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to “other managed” from a “stabilized” arrangement, effective March 30, 2016."
2016,734,Swaziland,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The Central Bank of Swaziland Order of 1974 is the legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement.
2016,144,Sweden,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the krona is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are allowed under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., participation in concerted interventions with other CBs). Effective February 14, 2017, the Executive Board of Sveriges Riksbank (SR) decided that the SR shall be able to intervene on the foreign exchange market as a complementary monetary policy measure if interventions are considered necessary to ensure that developments in the krona exchange rate do not constitute a serious risk to the upturn in inflation. This mandate extends to October 25, 2017. Foreign exchange interventions were first introduced as a potential complementary measure on January 4, 2016, at an extraordinary monetary policy meeting. The SR announces its intervention in a press communiqué, explains the motive, and discloses the framework of intervention. However, no intervention has been reported since June 14, 2001."
2016,146,Switzerland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market. However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free-market rates. On September 6, 2011, the SNB set a minimum exchange rate floor of CHF 1.20 per euro to contain deflationary risks. On January 15, 2015, the SNB decided to discontinue the minimum exchange rate floor of CHF 1.20 per euro. Ever since, the franc has been floating between 0.97 and 1.12 CHF per euro, with the SNB intervening occasionally. In 2016, the SNB intervened in the foreign exchange market to counter an undesired tightening of monetary conditions. These interventions occurred mainly at times of heightened uncertainty, when the Swiss franc was particularly sought after as a safe investment. After having traded in a volatile mode in H1 2016, the Swiss franc appreciated gradually against the euro in the context of rising political uncertainty in the Eurozone in H2 2016. Following the French presidential election in spring 2017, such appreciation was reversed amidst a sharp turn in risk sentiment and the exchange rate moved beyond CHF 1.08 per euro again. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual accountability report."
2016,463,Syria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Given the developments in the official rate, the emergence of the parallel market, and the intervention rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2016,923,Tajikistan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, with no predetermined path. The exchange rate of the somoni is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, in which the NBT may intervene to limit exchange rate volatility. The NBT publishes monthly information on the scope of its transactions on the domestic currency exchange market in the Banking Statistics Bulletin, and in special press releases that are posted on the NBT website and other news media, in which explanations are provided of NBT policies undertaken to regulate the domestic currency exchange market. For purposes of regulating the exchange rate formation process on the cash segment of the U.S. dollar buy/sell market during a period of excessive fluctuation in the exchange rate, the NBT set a daily rate for purchases and sales of U.S. dollar in cash. The NBT cancelled the procedure for setting rates for purchases and sales of U.S. dollars in cash and reinstated lending institutionsʹ right and authority to independently set these rates, on the condition that the selling rate may not be set higher than 1.5% of the official TJS (Tajik somoni) to U.S. dollar exchange rate (applied only in the cash segment of the domestic currency exchange market for retail transactions with the public). Effective April 8, 2017, the NBT lifted the procedure that requires the selling rate set by lending institutions to be no higher than 1.5% of the official TJS to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Since February 2016, the somoni has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from other managed, effective February 1, 2016."
2016,738,Tanzania,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. Most recently, the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) has participated in the interbank foreign exchange market on both sides – selling and buying. The policy intention of selling U.S. dollars has been to sterilize liquidity generated by government spending of aid funds, while on the buying side – to build the reserves and inject domestic liquidity. BOT foreign exchange sales have varied depending on the liquidity in the economy and the amount and effectiveness of other monetary policy instruments. Trading in the interbank foreign exchange market is conducted using the Reuters trading platform in a two-way quote system. The BOT is not required to indicate two-way quotes when it participates in the interbank market. In 2016, the shilling stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, with one realignment in January 2017. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from floating, effective January 8, 2016."
2016,578,Thailand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. Under the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the value of the baht is allowed to be determined by market forces, reflecting demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. In the case that the resulting movements in Thai baht (THB) are deemed excessive and unjustified by fundamentals, foreign exchange intervention can be undertaken. Since January 2016, THB has appreciated by around 4.8% against U.S. dollar (March 2017), while in terms of nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) and real effective exchange rate (REER), it has appreciated by 2%, 8%, and 1.1%, respectively. Despite some temporary volatility in late 2016 related to the passing of the King Bhumibol (in October) and the US elections, the baht has been on a gradual appreciation trend for most of the year. The baht resumed appreciation trend in Q1 of 2017 due mainly to the uncertainty of US policy and the anticipation of gradual path of the Fedʹs normalization."
2016,313,The Bahamas,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg arrangement. The Bahamian dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at par.
2016,648,The Gambia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Gambia participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the dalasi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15% of the central rate; however, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures. The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange to augment international reserves and ensure market orderliness. The Government of Gambia announced, May 4, 2015, that the U.S. dollar cannot be exchanged for more than 40 dalasi per U.S. dollar. A new foreign exchange directive, effective November 1, 2016, introduced a compulsory requirement for commercial banks to sell15% of their foreign exchange purchases to the CBG and established a reference rate to guide foreign exchange transactions. The dalasi has stabilized in a range between 43 and 46 dalasi per U.S. dollar. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed. The CBG does not publish intervention data. The Executive Directive in May 2015 fixing the dalasi exchange rate to not more than 40 dalasi to a U.S. dollar was rescinded, effective January 1, 2016. Since then the exchange rate continues to be determined by the fundamentals of demand and supply. The CBG still continues to intervene to build reserves and for market orderliness. Effective June 1, 2017, the requirement for banks to sell 15% of their foreign exchange purchases was rescinded."
2016,537,Timor-Leste,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely.
2016,742,Togo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Togo participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2016,866,Tonga,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. The external value of the paʹanga is determined on the basis of a weighted currency basket comprising the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and Fijian dollar. The basket weights are determined based on the proportions of trade with trading partners. The weights are not published. The exchange rate of the paʹanga in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) within a band of ±5% a month. The NRBT does not publish intervention data. Under Section 34 of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act, the external value of the paʹanga is determined from time to time in a manner approved by the NRBT board, after consultation with the Minister of Finance and National Planning, in view of Tongaʹs obligations connected with international monetary agreements in which it takes part. Section 35(1) of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act empowers the NRBT to set the exchange rate."
2016,369,Trinidad and Tobago,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. In 2016, the Trinidad and Tobago dollar depreciated within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar and stabilized anew since mid-July. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified twice (1) to a crawl-like from a stabilized arrangement, effective December 21, 2015, and (2) to a stabilized from a crawl-like arrangement, effective July 19, 2016. The Central Bank of Trinidad and Tobago (CBTT) routinely issues press releases on its direct intervention in the foreign exchange market."
2016,744,Tunisia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, as indicated on the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT—Banque Centrale De Tunisie) website. On April 18, 2012, a fixing arrangement (i.e., the average of market participantsʹ quotes) replaced the currency composite as the reference exchange rate published by the BCT. Since that time, the BCT has been using bilateral transactions to intervene in the foreign exchange market when market rates differ substantially from the dayʹs fixing rates, in order to smooth excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate for the dinar. Since May 2016, the dinar increased its flexibility and abandoned the crawling trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar/euro basket. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from a crawl-like arrangement, effective May 12, 2016."
2016,186,Turkey,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lira is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) announced the general framework of the monetary and exchange rate policies envisaged for 2017 in a presentation titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2017” on December 6, 2016. The CBRT may intervene directly or through flexible auctions in the market in both directions, in case of unhealthy price formation due to speculative behavior stemming from a loss of market depth. In that case, the CBRT may buy or sell foreign exchange at the rates quoted by the banks directly. The results of the CBRTʹs daily auctions and volume of its interventions are published on its website. The CBRT introduced the reserve option mechanism (ROM) as a new monetary policy tool in 2011. In this framework, the CBRT allows banks to hold a fraction of their mandatory reserves for lira liabilities in foreign currency and gold. The CBRT may increase or decrease the reserve option coefficients (ROCs), the amount of foreign currency or gold required to meet one unit of Turkish lira required reserve. Typically, the ROC is an increasing function of different tranches of lira required reserves; the tranches of the mechanism and the corresponding levels of ROC are determined by the CBRT. The ROM has been used as an active policy tool by the CBRT and has contributed to stabilization of capital flow volatility, indirectly influencing exchange rate movement. Given the CBRTʹs policy focus on limiting exchange rate volatility through the ROM, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2016,925,Turkmenistan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT) is responsible for exchange rate policy implementation.

2016,746,Uganda,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The authorities intervene in Ugandaʹs foreign exchange market when short-term fluctuations jeopardize its orderly operation. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM) at the banksʹ quoted rates using the best bid-ask principle. The BOU publishes information on its interventions in its monthly, quarterly, and annual reports, including amounts purchased and sold through the reserve buildup program, interventions, and targeted transactions."
2016,926,Ukraine,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement are classified as floating. The Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2017 and Medium Term (approved by the NBU Council December 21, 2016) call for the NBU to maintain a floating exchange rate arrangement, meaning that monetary policy will not be aimed at achieving a certain exchange rate target or range. At the same time, the NBU will use foreign currency interventions for the purpose of accumulation of international reserves, smoothing out the functioning of the foreign exchange market, and maintaining the transmission of the key interest as the core monetary policy instrument."
2016,466,United Arab Emirates,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The dirham was pegged to the U.S. dollar in 1980. A January 2003 decision made the peg official. The United Arab Emirates Central Bank (UAECB) does not publish its intervention data.
2016,112,United Kingdom,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating. The exchange rate of the pound sterling is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of England (BOE) has a separate pool of foreign exchange reserves, which it uses at its discretion to intervene in support of its monetary policy objectives. A monthly press release issued by Her Majestyʹs Treasury (HMT) reports HMT and BOE intervention. There were no foreign exchange interventions during 2016."
2016,111,United States,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating; the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are not formally ruled out in the United States, but they are rarely used. The secretary of the Treasury is responsible for the formulation and implementation of international monetary and financial policy, including foreign exchange market intervention policy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has separate legal authority to engage in foreign exchange operations, which are conducted in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury to ensure consistency with U.S. international monetary and financial policy. The Treasury and the Fed have closely coordinated their foreign exchange operations since early 1962, when the Fed commenced such operations at the request of the Treasury. Operations are conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as fiscal agent of the United States and as the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. Interventions are announced when they occur and the size of the interventions is reported in the Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations quarterly bulletin. U.S. authorities last intervened in the foreign exchange market in March 2011, following the earthquake in Japan, in a coordinated G7 effort to sell Japanese yen. The United States did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2016."
2016,298,Uruguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the peso is determined on the basis of supply and demand, although the CBU reserves the right to intervene to cushion abrupt changes in a concentrated market of few transactions. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The CB periodically intervenes in the exchange market to smooth excess exchange rate volatility. The CBU publishes information on intervention on its website."
2016,927,Uzbekistan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of the supply of and demand for foreign exchange (Article 15 of Law of the Republic of Uzbekistan No. 556-II on Foreign Exchange Regulation of December 11, 2003). The sum–U.S. dollar exchange rate is used as an operational benchmark, since 95% of the countryʹs trading operations are carried out in U.S. dollars. With the aim of preventing sharp movements in the exchange rate and supporting the exchange rate level that is in line with targeted macroeconomic indicators and monetary policy, the Central Bank of the Republic of Uzbekistan (CBU) participates in currency trading, acting as a buyer and seller of U.S. dollars and euros. Given that the sum has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2016,846,Vanuatu,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Since 1988, Vanuatu has officially maintained an adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement. Currently, the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a transaction-weighted (trade and tourism receipts) basket of currencies whose weights and composition are not publicly disclosed and are adjusted periodically. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed, because the composite weights are not disclosed and cannot be confirmed, and, in practice, the vatu has been slightly more volatile against a composite than the 2% band typical of stabilized or pegged arrangements."
2016,299,Venezuela,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate is a conventional peg against the U.S. dollar. Effective March 10, 2016, a fixed exchange rate called the Protected Exchange Rate (DIPRO) (Exchange Rate Agreement No. 35 published in the official gazette G.O. No. 40,865 on March 9, 2016) was set at Bs 10.000/US$ (selling) and Bs 9.975/US$ (buying). Variable exchange rates: There are an additional four official exchange rates, namely: (1) The rate produced by the Complementary Foreign Exchange Administration System (SICAD) in special auctions or from securities denominated in foreign currencies issued through the system, which stood at Bs/US$13.15 at end-2015—no auctions were held in 2016 (Exchange Agreement No. 26 of April 3, 2014 published in G.O. No. 40,391 of April 10, 2014). (2) The rate derived from the Alternative Foreign Exchange System (SICAD II), which corresponds to the weighted average of purchase and sales operations in foreign currency or securities denominated in foreign currencies, conducted on a daily basis through this system. However, it should be noted that SICAD II operations were suspended February 12, 2015, therefore the applicable exchange rate is the rate from the systemʹs last trading session published on the website of the BCV, which is Bs/US$51.9710 (buying) and Bs/US$52.1013 (selling). (3) The weighted average of purchase and sales operations in foreign currency or securities denominated in foreign currencies, conducted on a daily basis in highly liquid markets and in securities regulated under Exchange Agreement No. 33 of February 10, 2015, which stood at Bs/US$672.0772 (buying) and Bs/US$673.7617 (selling) at end-2016. (4) Effective March 10, 2016, the rate established as the Complementary Floating Market Exchange Rate (DICOM) under Exchange Rate Agreement No. 35 of March 9, 2016 (G.O. No. 40,865 of the same date). Pursuant to Article 17 of that Agreement, until the alternative foreign exchange markets provided for in Exchange Agreement No. 33 are replaced, the DICOM will be the rate referenced in Article 24 of the latter Exchange Agreement. It should also be noted that, pursuant to Article 13 of the aforesaid Exchange Agreement No. 35, all foreign exchange operations not expressly stated in the Exchange Agreement will be settled through the alternative foreign exchange markets regulated by the exchange regulations at the complementary floating market exchange rate. Because the bolivar has followed a depreciating trend since mid-March 2016, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from a conventional peg, effective March 07, 2016."
2016,582,Vietnam,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Clause 2, Article 15 Decree No. 70/2014/ND-CP of July 17, 2014, clarifies the following: (1) The official exchange rate is determined based on demand and supply in the foreign exchange market under State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) regulations. The SBV regulates the exchange rate by deploying monetary policy instruments and intervening in the foreign exchange market. (2) The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, and is determined by the SBV based on a currency basket of countries with trade, financing, and investment relationships with Vietnam, consistent with macroeconomic targets of each period. Decision No. 2730/QD-NHNN specifies that the central exchange rate is announced daily, based on reference of the interbank-weighted exchange rate, exchange rate developments in global markets of some currencies whose are Vietnamʹs major investment, credit, and trading partners, monetary and macroeconomic balances, and monetary policy targets. In 2016, the dong remained stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. The dong–U.S. dollar exchange rate might fluctuate around the official exchange rate within a daily transaction band of ±3%. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2016,474,Yemen,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been free floating since July 1996. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) receives most of the foreign exchange proceeds, particularly crude oil export revenues, official loans, and official development assistance. In 2016, after an adjustment of 16.4% in April, the official exchange rate remained steady at about Yrls 250. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2016,754,Zambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The official exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) intervenes primarily through transactions with ADs, which are registered commercial banks that meet the prescribed eligibility criteria under the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) Framework. BOZ interventions are published as historical data, and its foreign exchange transactions are published in the biweekly statistics."
2016,698,Zimbabwe,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The Zimbabwean dollar is no longer used as the domestic currency for economic, financial, and administrative purposes as of February 2009. The Zimbabwean dollar demonetized through Statutory Instrument 70 of 2015, gazetted on June 12, 2015; the process lasted from June 15, 2015, to September 30, 2015. The purpose of demonetization of the local unit was to promote consumer confidence and business confidence by providing credibility to the multicurrency system and legally retiring the Zimbabwean dollar. Effective October 31, 2016, Statutory Instrument 133 of 2016, Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Amendment of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Act, empowered the RBZ to issue bond notes and bond coins, at parity with the U.S. dollar, to alleviate the domestic liquidity conditions. The statutory instrument prescribes that a tender of payment of bond notes and coins issued by the RBZ are exchangeable at par value with any specified currency prescribed as legal tender in Zimbabwe and shall be legal tender in all transactions in Zimbabwe. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to other managed from an arrangement with no separate legal tender, effective October 31, 2016."
2017,512,Afghanistan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market through three times-weekly selling auctions. The results are published on the DAB website. The DAB deals with ADs only through the auction. The primary goal of these auctions is to regulate the growth of reserve money and/or currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction exchange rate volatility. Because the Afghani has followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since April 2017, the de facto ER arrangement was reclassified to crawl-like from floating, effective April 5, 2017. The DAB publishes intervention data on its website."
2017,914,Albania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lek is based on supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Albania (BOA) is not usually active in this market. In accordance with its regulations, intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) calming a disorderly market, which arises due to seasonality and lack of market depth. Interbank market bid-ask spreads, total market turnover, and speed of one-way moves are taken into consideration when intervening to calm a disorderly market. Excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market is considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementing and Advising the Monetary Policy. Foreign exchange market liquidity has improved over time, and the last time the BOA intervened to calm a disorderly market was in the first half of 2009; (2) considerable exchange rate misalignment with fundamentals: The lek is considered misaligned with fundamentals if there is lengthy overshooting of the exchange rate in any side; and (3) to increase the international reserves at the BOA. To this purpose, the level of interventions is assessed based on an optimization model of holding reserves, and constrained by the minimum threshold of accumulating foreign reserves to cover at least four months of imports in the medium-term as well as the countryʹs short-term external debt. In order to improve transparency, BOA uses auctions only for the purpose of accumulating foreign exchange reserves. This practice has been communicated to the banks and will be part of a regulation change in the near future. When the BOA intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market, its counterparties are the commercial banks; if necessary, it may carry out its intervention with foreign exchange bureaus. The BOA intervenes through (1) verbal intervention, in the form of press releases in the print or electronic media and/or press conferences; and (2) transactional intervention. The latter can take two forms, direct intervention and intervention via preannounced auctions. In the case of direct intervention, the exchange rate is determined by commercial banksʹ quotes and the BOA Monetary Operations Departmentʹs quotes. When the intervention exchange rate is uniform for all counterparties, the BOA publishes that rate on its Reuters page and simultaneously communicates the rate to commercial banks that do not participate in the Reuters system and to foreign exchange bureaus with which it has contact. When different exchange rates are used, the BOA announces only the fact that it has intervened. It publishes with a three-month lag the amount of the intervention in a quarterly bulletin that summarizes its foreign exchange operations with banks and the public sector. The regulation regarding foreign exchange interventions includes the option to carry out transactional interventions via auctions announced in advance. The BOA announces the date, amount, and currency it wants to buy at least one month before the auction, and the banks submit one bid each (in an amount equal to the limit it has provided the BOA). The BOA decides how much to buy based on the rates offered and its target amount. Following the auction, the BOA publishes the amount offered by commercial banks, the amount accepted by the BOA, the range of offered bids, the range of accepted bids, and the prorate at the maximum accepted bid. Swaps with the central government constitute an indirect intervention channel. The BOA aims to avoid disruptions from large and irregular demand of foreign exchange by MOF, to better manage liquidity. In 2017, the exchange rate has marginally appreciated as a result of large official inflows, FDI, and tourism income. During 2017, BOA has bought limited amount (71.19 mio Euro or 1.33% of total trading volumes of commercial banks in the interbank market, exchange bureaus, and clients) through auctions. So far in 2018, the purchases through auctions have been 46.30 million Euros. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2017,612,Algeria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Bank of Algeria (BA) does not announce the path of the exchange rate. The external value of the dinar is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the BA is the main seller because of significant inflows related to commodity exports, including hydrocarbons, which, under current law, must be surrendered to the BA. The BA manages the dinar with reference to a basket of currencies, and the rate of the dinar relative to the currencies in the basket is based on balance of payments data. The BA has not set a target range for fluctuation of the dinar outside or within any particular band, and the observed exchange rate movements do not confirm any constant weights of the currency composite. On April 9, 2018, the average of the buying and selling rates for the U.S. dollar was US$1 = DZD 114.22, equivalent to SDR 1 = DZD 165.49. No margin limits are imposed on the buying and selling exchange rates in the interbank foreign exchange market, except for a margin of DA 0.015 between the buying and selling rates of the BA for the dinar against the U.S. dollar. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement. The BA does not disclose information about its interventions."
2017,614,Angola,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; however, the BNA closely monitors exchange rate fluctuations to try to maintain price stability in the economy and frequently intervenes in the foreign exchange market by holding foreign exchange auctions and direct sales. The BNA and the commercial banks determine the recipients of foreign exchange and prioritize certain imports. The BNA receives foreign exchange from the taxes paid by oil companies to the government, and buys foreign exchange from oil companies that make payments to residents for services provided to them in kwanza. Effective January 1, 2018, the BNA adopted a regime of (unannounced) bands for the fluctuation of the kwanza against the euro, and conducted two auctions under the system that led to significant depreciation of the kwanza. To stem exchange rate overshooting, the BNA then set a new foreign exchange auction system in which bids could fluctuate within a plus/minus 2 percentage point band around the average exchange rate of winning bids of the previous auction, de facto capping the maximum depreciation of the exchange rate at 2% per auction. While the kwanza has depreciated around 35.5% against the U.S. dollar since early January 2018, more observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until the next review, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a stabilized arrangement. The BNA publishes the auction results and respective reference rates."
2017,311,Antigua and Barbuda,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Antigua and Barbuda participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been in excess of 95%."
2017,213,Argentina,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the peso, which is determined in the MULC (Mercado Único y Libre de Cambios—Local Foreign Exchange Market) by supply and demand, applies to all transactions in foreign exchange and foreign currency banknotes. During 2017, the elimination of foreign exchange controls continued, and ultimately with the entry into force July 1, 2017 of Communication A 6244, it was established that all individuals and legal entities, equity concerns, and other estates may operate freely on the foreign exchange market through authorized institutions, without making the distinction by the type of operation and/or residence of the customer. Notwithstanding the above, the BCRA reserves the power to operate in the exchange market to manage its balance sheet and prevent unjustified fluctuations in the exchange rate."
2017,911,Armenia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The CBA intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility, defined as short-term, high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by speculative or trend-following elements rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. The CBA intervenes anonymously mainly via auctions of foreign exchange, or openly in the interbank market, or through the stock exchange. The CBA publishes weekly intervention data through the stock exchange only on its website every Monday. During 2017 foreign exchange market was mostly balanced and Armenian dram was subject to only small volatilities. Central bank accumulated foreign reserves, to retain reserve buffers, when possible, as it was proposed by Staff report (Article IV Consultation and Fifth and Final Review under the Extended Arrangement). During 2017 the net purchase of foreign exchange totaled 100 mln dollars. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2017,314,Aruba,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg.
2017,193,Australia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"Both the de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as free floating. However, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) retains discretionary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market and has done so during periods of significant market disorder and/or gross misalignment of the exchange rate. Given the high level of development of the Australian foreign exchange market, interventions have been rare. The most recent period of intervention was in 2007–08 and was in response to episodes of significant market disorder—that is, instances when market functioning was impaired to such a degree that it was clear that the observed volatility was excessive. The RBA may also vary the way intervention is conducted; it may enter the interbank foreign exchange market directly through voice or electronic brokerage platforms or use an agent bank. As a matter of government policy, most wholesale purchases of foreign currency by government agencies are made through the RBA. The RBA manages the flows from purchases on behalf of the government so as to minimize their market impact—e.g. by executing these trades when the market is liquid and, if necessary, breaking up the required purchases into a series of smaller transactions. Monthly purchases and sales of foreign exchange are published on the RBA website. Daily data on foreign exchange market interventions are published on the RBA website annually, following the release of the RBA Annual Report."
2017,122,Austria,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Austria participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2017,912,Azerbaijan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Effective January 12, 2017, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) announced a change of the de jure exchange rate arrangement to a free floating from a managed floating arrangement and eliminated the requirement for banks to buy or sell foreign currency at a range of no more than 4% from the official exchange rate. The exchange rate of manat rests on fundamental factors determining the supply and demand ratio in the foreign exchange market. Under this decision, the CBA initiated a new currency auction mechanism, while limits on fluctuation of the market currency exchange rate compared to the official rate were eliminated. The new auction mechanism is organized on the unilateral basis, in which the CBA provides the auctionʹs operational platform, and the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan (SOFAZ). Currency has realized on the basis of offered prices by the market players. This mechanism implies selling currency to the customer offering the higher price at the first place. The amount of the currency to be offered at an auction will be announced in advance. Previously, the CBA intervened to smooth out excess volatility and influences the market exchange rate by intervening in the foreign exchange market to maintain the official rate within a prescribed corridor of ±4%, and had an exchange rate policy based on a currency basket comprising the U.S. dollar and the euro. In 2017–18, the balance of payments in Azerbaijan was balanced, which stabilized the situation both in the cash and non-cash foreign exchange markets of the country. Because the manat has been stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since April 2017, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from other managed, effective April 14, 2017. The CBA publishes its foreign exchange intervention data quarterly."

2017,513,Bangladesh,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The BB intervenes in the foreign exchange market to contain undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Since January 2017, the taka has followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to crawl-like from stabilized, effective January 10, 2017. The taka depreciated by 4.8% from January 2017 to December 2017. Apart from Annual Report, the BB publishes information on its intervention (if any) in Bangladesh Bank Quarterly (BBQ) and Monetary Policy Statement (MPS)."
2017,316,Barbados,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The minister of finance, after consultation with the Central Bank of Barbados (CBB), pegged the Barbados dollar to the U.S. dollar on July 5, 1975, pursuant to the Exchange Control Act and the Central Bank of Barbados Act. Intervention data are published in Economic and Financial Statistics Section H, Table 2."
2017,913,Belarus,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating. On January 9, 2015, the National Bank of the Republic of Belarus (NBRB) switched to a more flexible exchange rate policy that provides for minimizing currency interventions in the medium term while limiting the daily volatility of the value of the basket of currencies. To that end, in practice use is made of an operating rule limiting the possibility of NBRB to influence the determination of the exchange rate. Currency interventions are, in fact, used to reduce the daily volatility of the exchange rate, and not for regulating its level. In that context, the share of Russian rubles in the basket has increased to 50%, whereas the U.S. dollar and euro shares are 30% and 20%, respectively. As a result of the Belarusian rubel tracking a composite—because the exchange rate is not close enough to be classified as a stabilized arrangement against a composite—the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed. The NBRB does not publish data on its interventions."
2017,124,Belgium,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Belgium participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender.

Benin participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the Operations Account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO September 20, 2005."
2017,514,Bhutan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis the Indian rupee. No current legal documents establish a fixed exchange rate arrangement; the ngultrum has been pegged at par to the Indian rupee since the introduction of the ngultrum in 1974. Under the Royal Monetary Authority Act of Bhutan 2010 (Provisions 88 and 89), the Bhutanese government, on recommendation of the RMA, may declare the external value of the ngultrum, and the RMA will determine the appropriate external value. The RMA does not publish the intervention data."
2017,218,Bolivia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Plurinational State of Bolivia is a crawling peg to the U.S. dollar (also called a “sliding” rate) and is characterized by small exchange rate movements that are not announced in advance. The Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) determines the floor price for the daily competitive foreign exchange auction (“bolsín”) in which the financial private sector and, since 2013, the nonfinancial private sector as well participate. The CBB ensures that the exchange rate is consistent with moderate inflation, thus mitigating external and internal inflationary pressures, since the exchange rate is still used as a benchmark for the prices of nontradable goods, albeit to a decreasing extent due to bolivianization (dedollarization) in real and financial transactions. The exchange rates used in most exchange transactions fluctuate daily within a band of 12 centavos (1.7%), defined by the official buying and selling exchange rates (Bs. 6.86 and Bs. 6.96, respectively) plus a margin of one centavo at each end. Because the boliviano stabilized against the U.S. dollar since November 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The authorities consider that the de facto stabilized arrangement does not fully reflect the exchange arrangement managed by the CBB because the official policy of a crawling peg has not changed. The CBBʹs crawling peg mechanism allows the sliding rate to be set at zero without changing the arrangement if the underlying economic fundamentals warrant it. The CBB publishes information on its exchange market interventions and on its foreign exchange purchases and sales in the “Weekly Statistics” section and in other publications such as the Monthly Statistical Bulletin, all of which are available on its website."
2017,963,Bosnia and Herzegovina,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The CB covers base money with its foreign reserves, including currency in circulation and commercial bank deposits.

2017,616,Botswana,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as a crawling peg. The official exchange rate of the pula is determined according to a weighted basket of currencies comprising the SDR and the South African rand. The crawl rate is set as the difference between the Bank of Botswanaʹs (BOBʹs) inflation objective and the inflation forecast in major trading partner countries. The crawl rate is thus determined using a forward-looking approach and is revised regularly. In this approach, the authorities periodically determine the crawl rate for the subsequent period, such as the next 6 or 12 months. Effective January 4, 2017, the weights of the basket are 45% for the South African rand and 55% for the SDR, and the crawl rate was set to 0.26% (previously 0.38%). Effective January 3, 2018, the crawl rate was set at -0.3% (previously 0.26%), while the weights of the Pula basket remained unchanged. Decisions relating to this framework are made by the President of Botswana on the recommendation of the Minister of Finance and Economic Development after consultation with the BOB."

Under the Currency Interchangeability Agreement (CIA), signed in 1967, which remains in effect between the AMBD and the Monetary Authority of Singapore, the monetary authorities agree to the mutual exchange of their currency at par without charge. The monetary authorities and banks must accept each otherʹs currency at par, and the currencies are customary tender in both countries. Excess currency is repatriated regularly, with the cost borne by the currency-issuing authority. The AMBD must ensure that reserves in the Currency Fund cover at least 100% of the currency in circulation as required under the Currency Order, 2004 as amended by the Currency and Monetary (Amendment) Order, 2010. The AMBD publishes data on the reserves used to cover the currency in circulation in its annual report."
2017,918,Bulgaria,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board, which was introduced by the Law on the Bulgarian National Bank (BNB) of June 1997. The lev was fixed initially to the German mark and subsequently to the euro. The 1997 law was a conceptually new legal act, introducing the currency board mechanism, and cannot be considered an amendment to the previous law of the same name, which was in effect until 1997 and repealed by the new law. Aggregated data for daily euro–lev turnover between the BNB and local banks are published only on the BNB website, section Statistics/Data for Banking System Liquidity/Forex Operations between BNB and Banks.

However, under an intervention policy established by the government in close consultation with the Bank of Canada (BOC), the BOC may intervene in the foreign exchange market on behalf of the government. The current policy is to intervene on a discretionary, rather than systematic, basis and only in exceptional circumstances. The last time the BOC intervened was as part of the concerted intervention with authorities in Europe, Japan, the United Kingdom, and the United States to counter an excessively strong yen following the March 2011 earthquake in Japan. Earlier, the BOC intervened in September 1998 to influence movements in the Canadian dollar. Interventions are announced on the BOCʹs website, and the amount of intervention is published in the governmentʹs monthly official press release on international reserves."

2017,228,Chile,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate of the peso currently in effect is freely determined in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of Chile (BCCH) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market, in exceptional circumstances, to keep the currency near its equilibrium value in order to avoid costly future reversals. These interventions take the form of transparent, well-founded measures, including explicit definitions of the periods and amounts involved and clearly explained reasons for the intervention. The BCCH usually announces the amount of foreign exchange it intends to buy or sell in its monthly bulletin. It publishes its auction results daily and its reserves weekly. The BCCH has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since 2011."
2017,924,China,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"China officially maintains a de jure managed floating exchange rate arrangement with a view to keeping the RMB exchange rate stable at an adaptive and equilibrium level based on market supply and demand with reference to a basket of currencies to preserve the stability of the Chinese economy and financial markets. The floating band of the RMBʹs trading prices is 2% against the U.S. dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market—i.e. on each business day, the trading prices of the RMB against the U.S. dollar in the market may fluctuate within a band of ±2% around the midrate released that day by Chinaʹs Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS). The Peopleʹs Bank of China (PBC) announced that the RMBʹs floating range would be expanded in an orderly manner, based on the developments of the foreign exchange market and economic and financial situation. Based on the market demand and their pricing capacity, banks can determine their quotes of RMB against other currencies. There is no limit on the purchasing and selling prices of spot exchange and cash, which are determined by market supply and demand (PBC No. 2014/188). On August 11, 2015, the PBC decided to further increase the flexibility of the renminbi-to-U.S. dollar (RMB-to-USD) exchange rate midrate quoting mechanism, thereby enhancing the market determination of RMB exchange rates, and giving market supply and demand an even greater role in exchange rate formation. Because the RMB followed an appreciating trend within a 2% band against the basket of 24 currencies included in the CFETS index since June 2017, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to crawl-like from stabilized, effective June 1, 2017. The CFETS publishes its exchange rate index, and other RMB indices based on the Bank for International Settlements (BIS) currency basket and the SDR currency basket. Effective January 1, 2017, the number of currencies included in the CFETS RMB currency basket was increased from 13 to 24. The new currencies account for about 21% of the new basket and are included as they have become directly traded in the onshore foreign exchange market in 2016. The PBC does not publish its intervention data."
2017,233,Colombia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. All foreign exchange transactions are conducted at the market-determined exchange rate. On May 27, 2016, the BR announced that it would not hold new options auctions to reduce international reserves and would continue using intervention mechanisms based on their suitability for achieving policy objectives. The BR did not intervene on the foreign exchange market in 2017. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement."
2017,632,Comoros,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The Comoros participates in the franc zone area. The Comorian franc is pegged to the euro at the fixed rate of CF 491.96775 per euro; the value of other currencies is based on this fixed rate and on the exchange rates of these currencies in the foreign exchange markets. The exchange rate arrangement is established by the following documents: (1) the monetary November 23, 1979, cooperation agreement between the Comorian and French governments; (2) the November 23, 1998, decision by the European Council of Ministers authorizing France to maintain its monetary arrangements with the CFA area countries and the Comoros; and (3) the January 14, 1999, order of the governor of the Central Bank of Comoros (CBC) on euro–Comorian franc parity. Decree No. 87-005/PR, Regulating Financial Relations between the Comoros and Other Countries and its regulations apply. The government of either the Comoros or France may change the exchange rate arrangement after notification to the other party."
2017,238,Costa Rica,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, on February 2, 2015, under Article 5 of the legal act adopted during session 5677-2015 of the Board of Directors of the BCCR held January 30, 2015. Under this arrangement: (1) the BCCR allows the exchange rate to be freely determined by foreign currency supply and demand, but it may participate in the market in order to meet its own foreign currency requirements and those of the nonbank public sector (NBPS) and, at its discretion, to prevent drastic fluctuations in the exchange rate, in such a way that these actions will not interrupt the trend determined by the macroeconomic variables of that price (sterilization interventions); (2) the BCCR may carry out direct operations or use foreign currency trading instruments that it deems appropriate, in accordance with current regulations. In 2017, the colón depreciated by 2.5% (3.3% in 2016); however, its behavior differed in the first and the second halves of the year. While the upward pressure observed since 2016 persisted in the first half of the year, in the second half the trend reversed. The upward pressure on the exchange rate in the first half of the year was a response to the increased demand for foreign exchange, evidenced by negative earnings in the private foreign exchange market (“windows”). This increase in demand was linked, in large part, to financial operations (increased dollarization of financial savings and acceleration of the dedollarization of credit). The upward pressure was concentrated in the second half of the year, reaching a year-on-year depreciation rate of 9.2% by May 24. Sudden movements in the exchange rate not consistent with the trend driven by the macroeconomic determinants of that price led the CB to activate the “interday” intervention mechanism, for which it had up to US$1,000 million available in its reserve assets. This measure, together with interest rate adjustments, helped stabilize the foreign exchange market. Sales for foreign exchange stabilization purposes in 2017 amounted to US$771 million (US$303.3 million the previous year) and were concentrated in the months of May and June (US$227.7 million and US$252.6 million, respectively). Up to the second half of 2017, conditions on the foreign exchange market were consistent with its characteristic seasonal regularity patterns. The net earnings of the private market represented a surplus of US$766.8 million. This enabled the CB to satisfy the net requirements of the nonbank public sector (NBPS) and to replenish the foreign exchange sold to those entities in prior months. The CB participated in the foreign exchange market based on the behavior of supply and demand flows: in the first six months, by selling foreign exchange with a view to avoiding sudden movements in the exchange rate not justified by its macroeconomic determinants and, in the second six months, by making purchases that made it possible not only to satisfy the requirement of the NBPS, but also to replenish the foreign exchange sold to those entities in prior months. The first half of 2018 was marked by a private foreign exchange market with greater liquidity than in similar periods in prior years, which made it possible to satisfy the growing demand for foreign exchange in the NBPS, determined in large part by higher hydrocarbon prices on the international market (Costa Rica is an importer of hydrocarbons). As a result, the exchange rate exhibited stable behavior. In contrast to 2017, there have been no episodes of significant volatility this year or movements inconsistent with the trend of macroeconomic determinants, with the result that the required stabilization operations were smaller (US$73.8 million). The private foreign exchange market exhibited greater liquidity in the first seven months of the year. The surplus accumulated at windows totaled US$1,083.4 million, whereas in the same period of the previous year, it was negative by US$451.7 million. This surplus made it possible, in large measure, to satisfy greater foreign exchange demand from the NBPS than that observed in prior years. As of July 31, the NBPSʹs net requirement amounted to US$1,350.5 million (US$575.6 million in 2017), influenced by the increase in the international price of hydrocarbons. The average exchange rate in the foreign currency market (Monex) exhibited a cumulative change of 0.35% and a year-on-year change of 1.07% as of July 31, while for the same period of 2017, these benchmarks were 3.27% and 4.22%, respectively, when the price of foreign exchange was influenced by the greater preference of savers for instruments in foreign currency. The BCCR sold a net amount of US$73.8 million for stabilization purposes, which is less than the amount posted one year earlier (US$684.3 million). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."

2017,960,Croatia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating without a predetermined path. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) may set intervention exchange rates, which it applies in transactions with banks to limit exchange rate volatility. The CNB conducts foreign exchange auctions on a discretionary basis to ensure the stability of the kuna and provide liquidity for payments domestically and abroad (described under Section H.1.a.3. Auction). Since April 2016, the kuna has stabilized within a 2% band against the euro. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Intervention data (prices and volume) are published on the CNB website."

The external value of the koruna is determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) might participate. Effective April 6, 2017, the CNB removed its 3-year cap on the koruna, allowing it to appreciate beyond CZK 27.0 to the euro. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from stabilized, effective April 6, 2017. Data on CNBʹs foreign exchange operations are published on the CBʹs web page."
2017,636,Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Congo franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The BCC intervenes through an auction, which is the only operational framework for the BCCʹs transactions with the market. In 2017, the Central Bank intervened in the market through several operations to buy and sell foreign currency. The prices of copper and cobalt have improved substantially, which has impacted the DRCʹs foreign currency receipts. Cumulative tax revenue from mining and petroleum companies stood at US$906.3 million as at August 7, 2018, while cumulative revenue represented only US$582.0 million in 2017. On the other hand, the CDF depreciated by 20.2% over the same period in response to the behavior of public finance in the first half of the year. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed. Information on foreign exchange market interventions is published on the Internet in the BCC bulletin."
2017,128,Denmark,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The formal framework for the Danish fixed exchange rate policy is the ERM II. Denmark participates in the ERM II with a central rate of DKr 746.038 per €100. The central rate is a conversion of the central rate vis-à-vis the deutsche mark before the third stage of the EMU and was last adjusted in January 1987. Denmark has entered into an agreement with the ECB and the euro area member countries on a narrower fluctuation band of ±2.25%. In recent years, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) has consistently maintained a stable krone within less than 1% of the central rate. The DNʹs net purchase or sale of foreign currency during a month is published at 4:00 p.m. on the second working day of the following month in the Foreign Exchange and Liquidity press release. The agreement on Denmarkʹs fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro within a narrow fluctuation band of ±2.25% around the central rate in ERM II was concluded at an informal meeting of the ECOFIN Council of September 25–27, 1998, in Vienna, between the ministers of economy and finance and the CB governors of the EU member countries."
2017,611,Djibouti,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"Djiboutiʹs monetary system is based on a currency board. The Djibouti franc has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since 1949, but the legislation establishing the currency board and determining the fixed exchange rate is Law No. 118/AN/11/6ème L of January 22, 2011. The Central Bank of Djibouti (BCD) guarantees and provides for unlimited conversion to U.S. dollars of banknotes and coins used as legal tender in Djibouti.

2017,243,Dominican Republic,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed float. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) aims to increase gradually the flexibility of the exchange rate alongside the implementation of the inflation-targeting framework formally adopted in 2012. The CBDR does not pursue a particular fixed exchange rate level, but rather seeks to manage a pathway around its long-term equilibrium value, consistent with the fundamentals of the Dominican Republic economy and its inflation target. The CBDR intervenes in the foreign exchange market to avoid instances of excessive exchange rate volatility that might affect the inflation target given that the exchange rate pass-through remains high. Since February 2010, the peso has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar within a margin of less than 2%. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBDR publishes data on foreign exchange sales and purchases in the foreign exchange market by different institutional actors (financial intermediaries and remittance/foreign exchange agents). The data are published on a gross (all transactions) basis and a net basis (excluding interbank operations).

The U.S. dollar is the currency of Ecuador, which is freely circulating. All transactions and monetary and financial operations, as well as the relevant accounting records, executed in Ecuador shall be denominated in U.S. dollars in accordance with Articles 43 and 94 of the Monetary and Financial Organic Code. The circulation, exchange, withdrawal, and destruction of U.S. dollars, which is legal tender in Ecuador, shall be the exclusive power of the CBE, in accordance with the provisions established in this Code and the regulations prepared by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulation Board. The CBE and, in exceptional cases provided by the Board, institutions in the private financial system shall be required to meet demand for liquidity in the Republic of Ecuador in a timely manner to ensure that economic transactions are carried out in accordance with the regulations issued by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulation Board. For that purpose, they shall be authorized to carry out any remittances that may be required, that are not to be considered import or export operations. Such operations carried out by the CBE shall not be subject to any tax in the country. Under the legal mandate provided by the Organic Law for Economic Recovery, Strengthening of Dollarization, and Modernization of Financial Management, effective December 29, 2017, the CBE proceeded to close the electronic money accounts and to issue the balances to their holders. (1) The CBEʹs power to implement and administer electronic currency was eliminated (See Article 14 (21), Article 94 of the Monetary and Financial Organic Code). (2) It is established that electronic payment mechanisms will be implemented and operated by entities in the financial system (See Article 101 of the Monetary and Financial Organic Code). (3) It is ordered that all credit operations shall be credited through the national payment system by electronic fund transfer or other electronic payment mechanisms (See Article 194 (12), paragraph (a)). Against this backdrop, effective February 14, 2018, the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulation Board issued Resolution No. 441-2018-M “Regulation for Management of Electronic Means of Payment” establishing a section on management of the “Mobile Payment System” defined as the transfer of funds originating from a cellular telephone associated with an account with an institution in the national financial system to make and receive payments. In the Mobile Payment System, the CBE undertakes the role of oversight and supervision of the system, while the administration is responsible for institutions in the financial system."
2017,469,Egypt,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. On November 3, 2016, the CBE announced its decision to move, with immediate effect, to a liberalized exchange rate regime in order to quell any distortions in the domestic foreign currency market. Pursuant to the above, banks and other market participants are at liberty to quote and trade at any exchange rate. Bid and ask exchange rates are determined by forces of demand and supply. The CBE uses the prevailing market rate for any transactions it undertakes. Because the exchange rate stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since March 2017, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from floating, effective March 15, 2017. The CBE does not publish intervention data."

On January 1, 2001, the U.S. dollar became unrestricted legal tender with unlimited redeemability for the settlement of debt in El Salvador. The U.S. dollar is used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange. The Central Reserve Bank (CRB) must exchange colones in circulation for U.S. dollars at banksʹ request at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per U.S. dollar. Both the U.S. dollar and the Salvadoran colón are legal tender; payments may be made in either dollars or colones."

Equatorial Guinea participates in the CAMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CEMAC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (Joint Monetary Committee) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to amend the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.

2017,915,Georgia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Georgia is floating. The National Bank of Georgia (NBG) intervenes in the foreign exchange market through foreign exchange auctions, but does not make any explicit or implicit commitment with respect to an exchange rate target or path. Throughout 2017, the NBG made limited interventions, fewer in terms of both size and number compared to the previous year. Considering the market conditions, interventions were mainly made to fill international reserves. Net purchases by the NBG amounted to US$129.8 million. In 2017, the economic environment in trading partner countries improved substantially, which resulted in increased demand for Georgian exports and led to significant improvement in current account deficit. Particularly, exports of goods and services (especially, tourism) increased considerably. Moreover, money transfers rose substantially. As a result, pressure on the exchange rate coming from external shocks (in 2014–2015) and negative expectations somehow decreased. During the year, the nominal effective exchange rate (NEER) experienced episodes of both appreciation and depreciation. In the first half of 2017, NEER gained 6% compared to end-2016. Overall, the NEER depreciated annually by 1% at end-2017. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. The amount sold at the NBGʹs foreign exchange auctions and the average exchange rates are posted on the NBG website shortly after each auction."

2017,652,Ghana,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the cedi is determined in the market by both interbank foreign exchange activity and foreign exchange bureaus. Ghana joined the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the cedi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within a margin of ±15% around the central rate. However, the authorities have yet to implement these measures. The BOG does not publish information on its interventions. In the first quarter of 2017, the cedi exchange rate against the U.S. dollar was volatile and could be attributed to uncertainty over the macroeconomic policies of the new government. During the last three quarters of 2017, the cedi was relatively more stable."

2017,328,Grenada,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Grenada participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been in excess of 95%. The Eastern Caribbean dollar (XCD) is pegged to the USD at EC$2.70 = US$1."
2017,258,Guatemala,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. In accordance with the Monetary Law and the Currency Convertibility Law, Guatemala has a flexible exchange rate arrangement under which the rate is determined in the foreign exchange market by supply and demand. However, the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the nominal exchange rate, without affecting its trend. The BOG intervenes through foreign exchange auctions based on a transparent rule, which limits daily volatility. On January 1, 2016, the fluctuation margin (added to or subtracted from the five-day moving average of the exchange rate) used to determine whether the BOG may intervene in the foreign exchange market was increased to 0.75%. Effective January 1, 2017, the maximum amount of daily currency purchases or sales was increased from US$32.0 million to US$40.0 million, which served to adjust the amounts auctioned to the increased volumes traded on the foreign exchange market, which had increased by 35.1% between 2009 and 2015. The BOG may also intervene when the nominal exchange rate shows unusual volatility, but this instrument has only been used once (during the international financial crisis). In 2017, although the intervention rule was triggered more frequently, it was used for the sole purpose of limiting volatility of the nominal exchange rate without affecting the upward trend observed since 2014. The nominal exchange rate appreciated 2.67% in 2017, an increase with respect to 2016 (1.67%). In 2017, BOG currency purchases on the foreign exchange market represented only 5.59% of the total volume traded on the market. Because the exchange rate has stabilized from end-March 2017 to mid-January 2018, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to stabilized from crawl-like, effective March 22, 2017. While the exchange rate has depreciated since end-January 2018, more observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a stabilized arrangement. The de facto methodology for classification of exchange rate regimes is based on a backward-looking statistical approach that relies on past exchange rate movement and historical data. Therefore, this reclassification does not imply statements or views on future or intended policies nor does it imply a policy commitment on the part of the country authorities. Intervention data are available on the BOGʹs website."
2017,656,Guinea,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Guinea announced its participation in the exchange rate mechanisms (ERM and ERM II) of the WAMZ, which formally limits the fluctuation of the franc to ±15% around a central rate vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, but this has yet to be implemented. The BCRG replaced the previous weekly foreign exchange allocation with a biweekly competitive auction, reflecting market demand for foreign currency. The BCRG adopted an intervention policy based on a budget of foreign exchange sales, and banks were allowed to negotiate freely foreign exchange sales and purchases with their clients. Previously, weekly fluctuation of the reference rate was capped at ±4% of the weekly auction rate. The BCRG regularly publishes information regarding foreign exchange market interventions. Since July 2017, the Guinean franc has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from other managed, effective July 3, 2017."
2017,654,Guinea-Bissau,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Guinea-Bissau participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The December 4, 1973, Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings into the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention, which France and the BCEAO signed September 20, 2005."
2017,336,Guyana,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; the exchange rate of the Guyanese dollar is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Guyana (BOG) periodically purchases foreign currency from foreign exchange dealers in order to maintain international reserves at acceptable levels. In accordance with bilateral agreements with the CARICOM CBs, the BOG quotes weekly rates for certain CARICOM currencies. Reflecting the stability of the Guyanese dollar against the U.S. dollar as a result of interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2017,263,Haiti,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to avoid excessive volatility. Because the gourde followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since June 2017, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to crawl-like from other managed, effective June 5, 2017. The BRH publishes information on foreign exchange interventions weekly on its website."
2017,268,Honduras,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling band. The exchange rate of the lempira is determined by foreign exchange auctions of the Central Bank of Honduras (BCH). The BCH maintains an operational band requiring all bid prices for the purchase of foreign exchange to be within a range of 7% above or below the base price, with the requirement that bids in auction not exceed 1% of the average base price of the auctions of the preceding seven business days (Resolution No. 271-7/2013 of the BCH). The base price is calculated weekly according to a procedure established by the BCH board of directors for this purpose, which includes the following variables: (1) the differential between the domestic inflation rate and the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners, (2) changes in the exchange rates of these countriesʹ currencies vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar, and (3) the performance of official reserve assets. The external inflation rate is considered to be the weighted average of the estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs main trading partners. Domestic inflation is measured by the consumer price index (CPI). The change in the U.S. dollar exchange rates of the main trading partners is measured using the effective exchange rate index, which is compiled weekly based on the weighted average of the main trading partnersʹ exchange rates expressed in units of their respective currencies to US$1.00. Finally, an adjustment factor is applied to the base price of the auction, depending on the number of months of imports covered by the BCHʹs reserve assets. In July 2011, the BCH (through Resolution No. 284-7/2011 of July 21, 2011) reactivated the crawling band system that had been in operation until mid-2005. As a result, following a long period of stability, the lempira was allowed to crawl once again in July 2011 and thereafter followed a steadily depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar, with a small one-time adjustment in November 2011. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling peg arrangement. The BCH publishes its sales of foreign exchange on its website daily."
2017,532,Hong Kong SAR,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires that the monetary base be backed at least 100% by, and that changes in it be matched 100% by corresponding changes in, the reserve currency (U.S. dollar) at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75–HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—has been in place since May 18, 2005. The monetary base includes issued notes and coins, the balance at the HKMA of banksʹ clearing accounts (i.e., the aggregate balance), and outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Consistent with currency board principles, the HKMA may issue additional Exchange Fund paper when there is an inflow of funds, and the program may expand along with the interest payments on such paper. Issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which back banknotes issued by note-issuing banks (NIBs), must be made against U.S. dollars at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per U.S. dollar. Issuance and withdrawal of government-issued notes and coins are settled against U.S. dollars at the same fixed rate. The legal documents that establish the currency board include the Basic Law (Chapter V, Section 1, Articles 110 and 111); the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66); and an exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system under the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The letters specify that the Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system, including the linked exchange rate. Section 3(1) of the ordinance, as amended, specifies that the Exchange Fund “shall be under the control of the Financial Secretary and shall be used primarily for such purposes as the financial secretary thinks fit affecting, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong SAR and for other purposes incidental thereto.” The HKMA is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments, and operational means for doing so, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary system. The HKMA makes immediate announcements of the impact on the aggregate balance due to purchases or sales of U.S. dollars by the Currency Board via various information vendors, including Reuters and Bloomberg. The information is also available on the HKMA website."
2017,944,Hungary,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating because of discretionary intervention by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) in the foreign exchange market. The possible objectives of foreign exchange intervention are listed in the MNBʹs intervention strategy, which has not been published. The strategy aims to avoid disruptive market fluctuations and exchange rate overshooting. However, the strategy emphasizes that the MNB generally refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange market. The MNB converts foreign currency for the government and net current and capital transfers from the EU at market rates. These transactions change the foreign exchange reserve position of the MNB. If the resulting reserve dynamics are not in line with the MNBʹs reserve management objectives, some of the funds are channeled to the market. Transactions are small and conducted at market prices. The MNB announced the policy of channeling the foreign-exchange position resulting from EU transfers several times in the past, most recently in March 2009 for that year. Until 2009, the net amounts were published quarterly in the MNBʹs quarterly and annual reports. The MNB no longer publishes intervention data."
2017,176,Iceland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. In 2017, the Central Bank of Iceland (CBI) continued to follow the strategy of active foreign exchange market intervention as set forth by the Monetary Policy Committee (MPC) in May 2013. The CBI transactions accounted for about 55% of total market turnover, broadly the same as in 2016, and the total turnover increased by some 50% year over year. Early in the year, the CBI bought foreign currency with the primary objective of bringing the foreign exchange reserves to the desired size during the prelude to general capital account liberalization. After that objective was achieved, it became more important to mitigate fluctuations in the exchange rate and to prevent overappreciation before taking important steps in the liberalization process. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. The CBI publishes monthly data on its interventions in the foreign exchange market."
2017,534,India,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is largely market determined, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market to manage excessive volatility and maintain orderly conditions without any fixed target or band for the exchange rate. The RBI publishes monthly data on its interventions (foreign exchange purchases and sales) in its monthly bulletin with a six-week lag."
2017,536,Indonesia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating (adopted August 14, 1997). The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Bank Indonesia (BI), however, may intervene—as part of a policy mix—whenever necessary to achieve the inflation target and to maintain macroeconomic stability. When it intervenes, the BI does not target a specific rate or maintain exchange rate movements within a specific band; rather it provides liquidity to maintain market stability. Because the exchange rate has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since January 2017, with one realignment in September 2017, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to stabilized from floating, effective January 12, 2017. While the Indonesian rupiah has increased its volatility since January 2018, more observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as stabilized. The BI does not disclose data on its interventions."
2017,433,Iraq,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as a conventional peg arrangement. The Central Bank Law gives the Board of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) the authority to formulate exchange rate policy. Effective January 2, 2017, the cash and transfer exchange rate was set at ID 1,184 plus ID 6 (fees) per U.S. dollar. Effective May 24, 2018, the official exchange rate was set at ID 1,190 per U.S. dollar including the Central Bank commission according to the closing prices of the daily bulletin of gold & main currencies published on the CBI website (www.cbi.iq). The CBI provides foreign exchange at the official exchange rate for permissible transactions through its daily auctions (allocations), establishing a peg. However, because certain transactions are excluded from access to the CBI auctions, many transactions take place at parallel market exchange rates. The CBI publishes the daily volume of the auction allocation on its website."

2017,429,Islamic Republic of Iran,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a managed floating arrangement against a basket of currencies since 2002. Effective April 10, 2018, the official and parallel exchange rates have been unified. In order to maintain a unified exchange rate and reduce the spread between official and parallel market rates, the CBI has decided to sell oil and gas revenues in the interbank as well as in the parallel market. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2017,436,Israel,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the Bank of Israel (BOI) may intervene in the foreign exchange market in the event of unusual movements in the exchange rate that are inconsistent with underlying economic conditions or when conditions in the foreign exchange market are disorderly. The BOI purchased US$6.60 billion in the foreign exchange market during 2017 (US$6.04 billion in 2016 and US$8.77 billion in 2015), of which US$1.50 billion (US$1.80 billion in 2016 and US$3.10 billion in 2015) was part of the purchase plan to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate and the rest was under the foreign exchange policy announced in August 2009. The BOI announced, November 23, 2017, that it will purchase US$1.5 billion in 2018 in the foreign exchange market to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. The BOI publishes monthly purchase information."

2017,343,Jamaica,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market, in which the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) intervenes occasionally with sales and purchases of foreign currency. From October 2016, the exchange rate stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, but increased its volatility since September 2017. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified twice (1) retroactively to stabilized from a crawl-like arrangement, effective October 31, 2016, and (2) to floating from a stabilized arrangement, effective September 15, 2017. The BOJ publishes information on its interventions in its Annual Report and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report."
2017,158,Japan,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the yen is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disorderly conditions in the market. The principal intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. Interventions fall within the mandate of the MOF, which publishes daily purchases and sales amounts as well as intervention currencies on its website. The Bank of Japan (BOJ), acting as agent of the minister of finance, intervenes in the market through financial institutions and/or brokers. The last time the MOF intervened in the foreign exchange market was from October 31 through November 4, 2011 (¥9,091.6 billion) to address excess volatility and disorderly exchange rate movement. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating."
2017,439,Jordan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dinar is officially pegged to the SDR, but in practice, it has been pegged to the U.S. dollar since late 1995. The CBJ is responsible for maintaining the stability of the dinar exchange rate."
2017,916,Kazakhstan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"On August 20, 2015, the National Bank and the Government of the Republic of Kazakhstan announced the transition to a de jure free floating exchange rate arrangement for the tenge. Participation by the National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) in currency trading was not systematic during 2017 and it was dictated exclusively by the need to smooth out sharp destabilizing fluctuations. In 2017, the exchange rate of the tenge fluctuated between 310.40 and 345.00 tenge to the U.S. dollar. The tenge followed a strengthening trend from the beginning of 2017 through May 2017, supported by a favorable external environment and rising exports. A decline in oil prices and weakening of the Russian ruble in June caused pressures on the exchange rate, which resulted in a depreciation of the tenge by 5.3% between May 30 and June 23. The NBK intervened by selling US$101 million on a net basis in June 2017 – the first intervention in 2017. Another bout of high volatility occurred in August–October, triggered by heightened depreciation expectations and increased demand for foreign currency by the population. The exchange rate fluctuated between 328.1 and 345.0 tenge to the U.S. dollar. In order to meet the excess demand for foreign currency, in August–October 2017, the National Bank sold US$519.4 million on a net basis, of which US$379.8 million was sold in October. As a result of the National Bankʹs measures, the situation in the foreign exchange market began to gradually stabilize starting in the second half of October 2017, and by the end of the year, the exchange rate stood at 332.33 tenge to the U.S. dollar. Overall, the National Bankʹs participation in the foreign exchange market throughout 2017 was minimal (1.7% of the annual volume of exchange trading). The NBK started publishing monthly data on foreign exchange interventions on a regular basis from 2016. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2017,664,Kenya,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. Official foreign exchange market interventions aim to moderate the rate of change and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than to establish a particular level. Data on interventions are only partially disclosed. If the Central Bank of Kenya (CBK) uses the auction system to intervene, the market is informed of the amount dealt and the average rate. (The average rate is published after the auction closes.) If the CBK chooses to intervene directly (i.e., by buying or selling foreign exchange from or to banks directly through the Reuters Dealing System), the market is informed but amounts and rates are not published. While the Kenya shilling has appreciated against the U.S. dollar since January 2018, more observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2017,734,Kingdom of Eswatini,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the rand. The Central Bank of Eswatini (Swaziland) Order of 1974 is the legal document that establishes the fixed exchange rate arrangement.
2017,826,Kiribati,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. There is no central monetary institution, and the authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange. The Australia and New Zealand (ANZ) Bank (Kiribati) Limited, the only commercial bank, quotes daily rates for 15 currencies on the basis of their respective rates against the Australian dollar."
2017,542,Korea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the won is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. As such, the system is managed in accordance with the principles defined by the free floating system, and the governmentʹs role is very limited to remain within the range allowed by the free floating system. However, because of the lack of information on the authoritiesʹ interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Korea (BOK) may intervene in the market with the funds of the BOK and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund when it is deemed necessary for the stability of the market. Interventions in the spot market or through derivatives in the forward market are not announced, and intervention data are not published. The Korean government and the BOK (the foreign exchange authorities) will disclose information on their net purchase in the foreign exchange market. The foreign exchange authorities will implement their disclosure in two stages. In the first stage, information will be disclosed on a semiannual basis, no later than three months after the end of each six-month period. Specifically, information for the period of July to December in 2018 will be disclosed by the end of March 2019, and information for the period of January to June in 2019 will be disclosed by the end of September 2019. In the second stage, from July 2019 onwards, information will be disclosed on a quarterly basis, no later than three months after the end of the respective quarter. Specifically, information for the period of July to September in 2019 will be disclosed by the end of December 2019. Henceforth, information will be disclosed on an identical period and time basis. The information will be disclosed on the website of the BOK."
2017,967,Kosovo,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. Since January 2002, when Kosovo unilaterally adopted the euro, this currency is a legal tender in the Territory and circulates freely. UNMIK Regulation No. 1999/4 of September 2, 1999 “On the currency permitted to be used in Kosovo” specifies in Section 1 that “Parties to a contract or any voluntary transaction may denominate such transaction in any currency agreed upon by the parties. Unless proven otherwise, such an agreement shall be deemed to exist with regard to any foreign currency that is widely accepted in the Territory of Kosovo.” Administrative Direction No. 1999/2 of October 4, 1999 “Implementing UNMIK Regulation No. 1999/4 of 2 September 1999 On the Currency Permitted to be used in Kosovo” designated Deutschmark (DEM) as the only currency to formulate accounts and to perform compulsory payments. Later, due to the changeover of DEM into euro, Administrative Direction No. 2001/24 of December 21, 2001 “Amending Administrative Direction No. 1999/2 implementing UNMIK Regulation No. 1999/4 on the currency permitted to be used in Kosovo” replaced DEM by euro (1 euro = 1.95583 DEM)."
2017,443,Kuwait,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. According to the law of the Central Bank of Kuwait (CBK), the exchange rate arrangement is specified by an “amiri” decree in consultation with the governor of the CBK (see CBK Law, Chapter I, Article II). The arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. Intervention data are not disclosed to the public."
2017,917,Kyrgyz Republic,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The NBKR may participate in the interbank foreign exchange market and when necessary it may take measures to smooth out excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate. In 2017, the exchange rate remained relatively stable between 67 and 70 soms per U.S. dollar. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2017,544,Lao P.D.R.,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange arrangement is a managed float. Since September 2016 the kip has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to crawl-like from stabilized, effective September 2, 2016."
2017,941,Latvia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Latvia participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2017,446,Lebanon,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime is free floating. In practice, the exchange rate remains within a very narrow band vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar (LL 1,501–1,514/U.S. dollar). Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Banque du Liban (BDL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market daily from 10:00 a.m. until 2:00 p.m., Monday through Thursday, and from 10:00 a.m. until noon on Friday. The BDL does not publish intervention data."

2017,668,Liberia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Central Bank of Liberia (CBL) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to smooth volatility. The exchange rate between the Liberian dollar and U.S. dollar at March 26, 2018 was L$131.5=US$1 (midpoint between buying and selling rates). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is other managed. The foreign exchange auction data (volume, price, etc.) are published on the CBL website."
2017,672,Libya,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are a conventional peg vis-à-vis the SDR. Since March 2014, the dinar followed an appreciating trend within a 2% band against the SDR and stabilized anew from January 2015."

2017,674,Madagascar,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the official interbank market. The Central Bank of Madagascar (CBM) intervenes in the interbank market to smooth large exchange rate fluctuations and meet foreign reserve targets. Information on CBM daily interventions is not publicly available. Only the weighted average daily rate and the number and amount of transactions are made available to the public through the CBM official site. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The year 2017 was characterized by substantial foreign exchange revenues for the vanilla sector funding the interbank foreign exchange market (MID), the level for which more than doubled in relation to 2016 (USD 650 million compared to USD 313 million). In 2017, the ariary depreciated by 10.07% in relation to the euro, but appreciated 3.52% in relation to the U.S. dollar. The CBM publishes its interventions (1) daily and only in terms of volume through the interbank foreign exchange market (MID) for participating banks, (2) daily and weekly by courier to the Ministry of Finance and Budget and the Presidency, and (3) weekly by mail to the IMF Resident Representative in Madagascar."
2017,676,Malawi,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Official intervention focuses on building foreign reserves and limiting exchange rate volatility while taking into account seasonal fluctuations. Since August 2016, the kwacha has stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2017,548,Malaysia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Bank Negara Malaysia (BNM) operates a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement. On September 26, 2016, BNM affirmed that market forces determine the direction and level of the exchange rate. Intervention in the market is limited to providing liquidity to ensure orderly market conditions. The ringgit has adjusted to reflect changes in the global economy including the developments in the U.S. economy. Strong expansion in exports and higher oil prices in 2017 contributed to the strength of the ringgit. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2017,556,Maldives,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Since 2011, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. This regime allows the rufiyaa to float within a 20% band around a central parity of Rf 12.85 per U.S. dollar. However, the rufiyaa remained stabilized in a narrow band against the U.S. dollar near the ceiling of the band (Rf 15.42 per U.S. dollar). Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Under the Maldives Monetary Authority Act, the president may decide to change the exchange rate arrangement and adjust the exchange rate."
2017,678,Mali,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Mali participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO September 20, 2005."

2017,682,Mauritania,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The ouguiya was previously de facto pegged to the U.S. dollar, at an exchange rate of UM 268.6 per U.S. dollar (October 24, 2005, through January 25, 2007). Since 2007, the new foreign exchange market uses a fixing system in which the Central Bank of Mauritania (BCM) intervenes. The BCM intervenes in order to regulate the exchange market according to its exchange rate policy objectives (smoothing the exchange rate and the projected level of official reserves). Since September 2014, the ouguiya has followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar until mid-2017. After a brief appreciation period in the second half of 2017, the ouguiya started depreciating again until April 2018. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. A summary statement of market turnover data is updated daily on the BCM website."
2017,684,Mauritius,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the rupee mostly followed movements on the international foreign exchange market as well as domestic demand and supply conditions. The exchange rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand forces in the domestic foreign exchange market. Interventions by the BOM in the foreign exchange market are limited to smoothing excessive exchange rate volatility. Information regarding foreign exchange intervention is disseminated on the BOM website as well as in the BOMʹs Monthly Statistical Bulletin, Monetary Policy and Financial Stability Report, and the Annual Report of the Bank."
2017,273,Mexico,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating; the exchange rate of the peso is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Foreign Exchange Commission (FEC), comprised of members of the CB and the MOF, determines the foreign exchange rate policy. The FEC does not target or defend any exchange rate level. In the past, Mexico implemented rule-based mechanisms to provide liquidity and promote the sound functioning of the foreign exchange market, as well as to cope with market volatility. These mechanisms were originally designed to work as an assurance to market participants, and the daily amount used was limited compared to the volume traded of the Mexican peso in the market. Since February 17, 2016, the FEC stopped all rule-based and regular auctions, and announced that it would instead rely on discretionary interventions only under extraordinary or unusual circumstances. All past auction results are publicly available. Effective February 21, 2017, the FEC announced a new intervention mechanism through a foreign exchange hedging program. The foreign exchange hedging is auctioned through non-deliverable forwards. The use of these forwards implies the settlement is in pesos. Currently, the FEC authorized up to US$20 billion of non-deliverable forwards, of which an outstanding amount of US$5.5 billion is placed in six different maturities of up to 12 months. At its maturity, each outstanding amount must be rolled over under a roll-over auction until the FEC instructs otherwise. As a result of this program, the first auction was held March 6, 2017, for US$1 billion with six different maturities. Subsequently, on October 25, 2017 the FEC announced that as part of the foreign exchange hedging program a further US$4 billion would be auctioned during the months of October, November, and December bringing the total amount to US$5 billion. On December 26, 2017, the FEC announced that a further US$ 500 million would be auctioned as part of the foreign exchange hedging program bringing the total amount to US$5.5 billion."
2017,868,Micronesia,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Micronesia is the U.S. dollar. The authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange.
2017,921,Moldova,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The National Bank of Moldova (NBM) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange interbank market in order to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of the leu against the U.S. dollar. Sharp fluctuations are not specifically defined; however, the NBM intervenes based on market conditions and future expectations of market participants. These interventions do not aim to change the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM intervenes directly at the market-quoted rates and publishes aggregated monthly data on its website regarding its interventions and interbank market turnover. The data show interventions by currency and type of operation (spot or derivative). In 2017, similarly to the previous year, the exchange rate of the MDL continued to be exposed to appreciation pressures against the U.S. dollar. The improvement of economic growth in host countries for migrant Moldovan workers, such as Russia and the EU, has led to a 13% increase in personal remittances after two years of decline. At the same time, in 2017 external trade activity has also intensified, with imports and exports of goods and services growing at a similar pace in relative terms (+20%), while the trade balance has deteriorated by around 21% (in absolute terms, imports are 72% higher than exports). However, the domestic foreign exchange market has not been significantly affected by this development, taking into account alternative sources of trade balance financing such as trade credits, external credits, and investments. Under these circumstances, the net foreign exchange supply from individuals and the net foreign exchange demand from businesses have both risen by around 5% as compared to the previous year. Consequently, for the second year in a row, the domestic foreign exchange market was characterized by an excess foreign currency liquidity, which basically persisted during the whole year 2017. This is not a typical development, especially during the heating season (November–March). In Q4 2017, the foreign exchange surplus registered on the domestic foreign exchange market was boosted, on the one hand, by a stronger foreign exchange supply from exporters of agricultural commodities, and on the other hand, by lower foreign exchange sales to energy resources importers (some of these agents have accumulated foreign exchange in advance in their accounts with domestic banks). Under these circumstances, the CB has withdrawn US$434 million from the domestic market, launching monthly purchase interventions in March, while stronger purchases (67% of total interventions) have been performed in July–October, which is in line with seasonal patterns. The same developments have maintained in the first semester of 2018. Unlike in the previous years, the persistence of appreciation pressures on the domestic currency, more prominently in Q1, has created the premises for NBMʹs purchase interventions starting with January, but subsequently the frequency of interventions and purchase amounts have been lowered."
2017,948,Mongolia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The BOM reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The BOM intervenes through the auction to moderate the rate of change in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. The BOM publishes the cutoff rate for each auction on its website. The BOM has introduced interbank (Bloomberg) trading platform “BMatch” in April 2017 where the BOM can intervene either through primary dealer or on its own account. As a result of rise in coal price in international market, foreign exchange inflow started picking up in early 2017. Also, due to IMF extended fund facility, exchange rate at the end of 2017 was 2427.13 incurring MNT appreciation of 2.5% or MNT 62.4. Subsequently, the BOMʹs intervention in the foreign exchange market through auction has dropped significantly."

2017,686,Morocco,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a composite. Since April 2015, the basket has been composed of the euro and the U.S. dollar, with weights of 60% and 40%, respectively. The Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) publishes its monthly foreign exchange purchases and sales on its website. The authority to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is found in Dahir No. 1-05-38 of November 23, 2005, promulgating Law No. 76-03 establishing the charter of the BAM (Chapter II, Missions, Section I, Core missions, Article 8). The exchange arrangement falls within the purview and prerogatives of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The BAM is responsible for its operational implementation (quoted rates, ranges) and any changes and monitors the foreign exchange market. Effective January 15, 2018, the limit for the exchange rate band in relation to the central rate was increased to +/?2.5% from +/?0.3%."
2017,688,Mozambique,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Both the de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. As a major conduit for foreign aid flows, the Bank of Mozambique (BM) is the main channel for foreign exchange into the market. It also intervenes to smooth seasonal fluctuations. For its transactions in Mozambiqueʹs interbank foreign exchange market (MCI) the BM uses the quotes shown on the screen for each commercial bank. The BM is therefore a price taker—i.e. it takes the highest foreign exchange selling rate and the lowest buying rate. The BM publishes information on its website regarding foreign exchange transactions in the MCI. It also publishes the schedule of MCI benchmark average exchange rates in the Jornal Notícias and on its website."
2017,518,Myanmar,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. In April 2012, the CBM started daily two-way multiple price foreign currency auctions, which provide a mechanism for the market to determine an exchange rate the CBM can use to set its new reference rate. However, the CBM reserves the right to intervene periodically to mitigate undue exchange rate volatility and support the liquidity of the kyat in the foreign exchange market. The CBM has no predetermined target for the level of the kyat exchange rate or its trading range and expects the value to fluctuate with supply and demand in the market. The cutoff rate in the CBMʹs daily foreign exchange auction is used as the CBM reference exchange rate for that dayʹs trading. The reference rate is used to set the midrate in the retail money changer (MC) market, in the wholesale interbank market for ADs, and for foreign exchange transactions with the government. Indicative cross-rates for certain other currencies are based on Thomson Reuters, Oanda.com, and the respective CBs. The maximum spread between the reference rate and market rate was 1.1% in 2018 (up to end of June). Because the kyat stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar since January 2017, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from other managed, effective January 12, 2017."

The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may intervene if the exchange rate is exceptionally high or low, if that rate is not justified by economic fundamentals, and if there is a material prospect that the intervention will influence the exchange rate. Interventions may not be used as an attempt to influence the long-term trend of the exchange rate. The RBNZ publishes information on its foreign currency assets and liabilities, including its foreign currency intervention capacity (stock of reserves available for intervention) and foreign exchange swap position, on its website but does not publish data on its direct intervention. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2017,278,Nicaragua,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a crawling peg.

2017,142,Norway,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as free floating; the krone floats freely and independently against other currencies. The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Norges Bank (NB) does not normally intervene to influence the exchange rate of the krone; however, it may intervene in the foreign exchange market on short notice if the krone deviates substantially from the level the NB considers reasonable in relation to fundamentals and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target. The NB may also intervene in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level. The NB has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999. Foreign exchange purchases or sales for the Government Pension Fund Global are publicly preannounced on the CB website. In extraordinary circumstances, the NB may provide foreign exchange liquidity via collateralized operations. This was done between September 2008 and July 2009."

On June 4, 2014, the BPNG introduced an exchange rate trading margin with a kina buying rate within 75 basis points (bps) above the interbank midrate and a kina selling rate within 75 bps below the midrate. Since August 2017, the exchange rate has followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to crawl-like from a stabilized arrangement, effective August 22, 2017."
2017,288,Paraguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand. The objective of the Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) under Article 3 of Law No. 489/95 is to preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Article 50 establishes that foreign currency trading by the CBP aims to smooth seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate. The CBP intervenes occasionally in the market to smooth the effects of undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. The CBP, as the governmentʹs financial agent, receives U.S. dollars from the government by way of royalties and compensation paid by the binational hydroelectric entities and exchanges them for guaraníes at the request of the government for the purpose of public expenditures. These dollars from the public sector are returned to the market through programmed sales. Accordingly, in July 2013, the CBP implemented a program of preannounced sales of the U.S. dollars it purchases from the government. This program indicates in advance the nature, frequency, and size of the CBPʹs foreign exchange transactions to avoid influencing market expectations of the exchange rate. Actions of the CBP in the exchange market are announced in advance. However, the CBP may deviate from the program of preannounced sales at any time. Data on CBP operations in the market, whether in the form of programmed or supplementary foreign exchange transactions, are updated weekly on the CBPʹs website."
2017,293,Peru,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,Peru has a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand. The Central Reserve Bank of Peru (BCRP) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility without altering the exchange rate trend. BCRP interventions can also be conducted through dollar-indexed bonds and foreign exchange swaps. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The BCRP publishes daily information about its intervention operations (prices and amounts) on its website.
2017,566,Philippines,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) adheres to a market-determined exchange rate policy with some scope for occasional action solely to prevent potentially disruptive sharp fluctuations. The BSP does not target or support a given level of exchange rate; it allows the value of the peso to be determined by supply and demand. The BSP may participate in the U.S. dollar–peso market directly with market participants or via market makers and does not disclose intervention data, which are for internal use only. Data on currency swaps settled in foreign currency and non-deliverable forwards settled in domestic currency are reported monthly in Sections II and IV, respectively, of the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which is posted on the BSP website. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2017,964,Poland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating; the exchange rate of the zloty is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, and the zloty is traded freely against all currencies. Narodowy Bank Polski (NBP, National Bank of Poland), however, may intervene in the foreign exchange market if necessary to ensure domestic macroeconomic and financial stability. The NBP does not disclose its intervention data. Given that NBP intervened in the foreign exchange market last time in 2013, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. The NBP did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2017 as well as in the first half of 2018. In addition, the MOF has continued the sale of foreign currency funds partially on the foreign exchange market and through the CB."
2017,182,Portugal,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Portugal participates in a currency union (EMU) with 19 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2017,453,Qatar,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement vis-à-vis the U.S. dollar. The targeted peg was officially authorized by Amiri Decree No. 34 of 2001 issued in July 2001, replacing the de jure exchange rate policy of pegging to the SDR, which had been in effect since 1975. The Qatar Central Bank (QCB) does not publish data on its interventions."
2017,634,Republic of Congo (Congo),973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the CEMAC is a conventional peg. The Republic of Congo participates in the CEMAC and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CEMAC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (Joint Monetary Committee) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to amend the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2017,962,Republic of North Macedonia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Under the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Article 33), the denar exchange rate is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. This arrangement is still in place under the current legislation. However, the National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia (NBRNM) participates in the foreign exchange market (Article 34), in order to achieve the goals determined with the monetary and the foreign exchange policies. The NBRNM is implementing the monetary strategy of targeting the nominal exchange rate against the euro, the intermediary objective of the monetary policy being the maintenance of the denar exchange rate stability. Thus, the NBRNM maintains a stable exchange rate within a narrow fluctuation band of bid-ask exchange rates determined by the Committee for Operational Monetary Policy. Size and direction of the interventions are published on a regular quarterly basis, in the Quarterly Report of the NBRNM (Balance of Payments section, Financial Account subsection, in the part commenting on the developments of the foreign exchange reserves). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2017,968,Romania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) may intervene to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations. There is no formal definition of excessive exchange rate fluctuations: the assessment is based on domestic and international market circumstances and on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The NBR intervenes either directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers. The NBR does not publish information on its interventions. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement.
2017,922,Russia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating. Under this arrangement, the exchange rate of the ruble is determined by market factors. Following the transition to the free floating exchange rate arrangement, the Bank of Russia (BR) retained the ability to intervene in the domestic foreign exchange market in the event of threats to financial stability. BR information about the frequency and volumes of the BRʹs foreign currency interventions is posted on the BRʹs website under the “Liquidity of the banking sector and monetary policy instruments” subsection of the “Statistics” section. Effective February 1, 2017, the MOF implemented a new mechanism of foreign exchange purchases and sales to enhance the stability and predictability of local economic conditions and to reduce the impact of price volatility in the global energy market on Russiaʹs economy and public finance. Trade volumes will depend on the amount of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget. As long as the actual Urals price exceeds the benchmark oil price of US$40/bbl (in real terms, adjusted for U.S. inflation), MOF will be purchasing, through the BR, foreign exchange in the amount of additional oil and gas revenues. If the actual prices drop below this level, MOF will be selling foreign exchange in the amount of the resulting shortfall of oil and gas revenues. The cumulative (from the beginning of operations) foreign exchange sales volumes should not exceed the cumulative purchase volumes. The size of these operations will be announced at the start of every month and purchases will be evenly distributed within the month. Effective January 1, 2018, only the current exchange rate is used to calculate the amount of foreign exchange purchase/sales. Previously the amount of foreign exchange purchases/sales took into account the difference between the current and budgeted exchange rates. Effective January 1, 2018, the condition that restricted the cumulative (from the beginning of operations) foreign exchange sales volumes not to exceed the cumulative purchase volumes was eliminated. The foreign exchange purchase program is preannounced, is predictable, involves small daily amounts, and is not triggered by an exchange rate level."
2017,714,Rwanda,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The National Bank of Rwanda (BNR) has intervened directly in order to prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate. Since March 2015, the exchange rate has followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BNR discloses its data on its interventions on the market."
2017,862,Samoa,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg vis-à-vis a currency composite. The Central Bank of Samoa (CBS) does not publish data on its interventions. The CBS Act of 2015 states that the CBS is responsible for setting the exchange rate.
2017,135,San Marino,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. On March 27, 2012, San Marino signed a monetary agreement with the EU repealing the previous monetary agreement of November 29, 2000. The agreement authorizes San Marino to use the euro as its official currency, grant legal tender status to euro banknotes and coins, and issue limited quantities of euro coins. San Marino is committed to adopting the relevant EU legislation (on euro banknotes and coins; combating fraud and counterfeiting; banking and financial legislation, including the prevention of money-laundering and statistical reporting requirements) within the time specified by that agreement. The list of legal acts to be implemented and the time limits for their transposition are reviewed each year by a “Joint Committee” as provided by Articles 8 and 11 of the Monetary Agreement."
2017,716,São Tomé and Príncipe,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg against the euro. Beginning February 1, 2009, the focus of the Bank of São Tomé and Príncipe (BCSTP) switched from the U.S. dollar to the euro, which became the new reference currency for the peg on January 1, 2010. The Organic Law of the BCSTP authorizes it to make decisions regarding exchange rate policy."
2017,456,Saudi Arabia,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The rate of the riyal against the U.S. dollar is determined by the Saudi Arabian Monetary Authority (SAMA) and has been stable since June 1986. The SAMA, in coordination with the minister of finance, decides on changes in the exchange rate arrangement. Historically, the SAMA has not published its intervention data."
2017,722,Senegal,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Senegal participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2017,942,Serbia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"In accordance with the revised IMF classification system of exchange rate arrangements, the de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The current Decision on the Dinar Exchange Rate Regime stipulates “managed floating.” Since the introduction of this exchange rate regime in 2001 and in accordance with its commitment to liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has tried to reduce its participation in the foreign exchange market and to adjust the features of the existing exchange rate regime in the direction of soft managed floating. This exchange rate regime enables the NBS to balance, when necessary, foreign exchange demand and supply and moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate in either direction (appreciation or depreciation) that may occur under the influence of external or internal shocks to the national economy. Since March 2017, the dinar followed an appreciating trend against the euro consistent with a crawl-like arrangement. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to crawl-like from stabilized, effective March 27, 2017. While the exchange rate appears to have stabilized since November 2017, more observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as crawl-like. The de facto methodology for classification of exchange rate regimes is based on a backward-looking statistical approach that relies on past exchange rate movement and historical data. Therefore, this reclassification does not imply statements or views on future or intended policies nor does it imply a policy commitment on the part of the country authorities."
2017,718,Seychelles,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand in the market. The CBS intervenes only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility. The CBS occasionally participates in the foreign exchange market for reserve accumulation. Operational guidelines designate the CBS as the buyer and seller of last resort in the foreign exchange market. The CBS discloses intervention data on its website, which is publicly accessible. On average, the Seychelles rupee depreciated vis-à-vis the major international currencies with the exception of the British pound sterling (GBP) which weakened against the domestic currency mainly as a result of the developments surrounding the Brexit negotiations. Developments in the exchange rate were attributed to both domestic and external factors. On the domestic front, a stronger tourism performance (both in terms of higher arrivals and spending) was observed in 2017 as compared to 2016. Despite an increase in supply of foreign exchange in the economy relative to 2016, demand for foreign exchange remained strong. During 2017, the CBS intervened in the foreign exchange market for reserves accumulation purposes and purchased a total of US$50 million. The reserves accumulation exercise was necessary in order to meet external payment obligations. On the external front, increase in international commodity prices, in particular the increase in the price of oil, coupled with a dampening in the performance of exports and a higher demand for imports, resulted in a worsening of the countryʹs trade balance. More so, economic recovery in Europe helped to strengthen the euro on the international market while uncertainty surrounding the Trump administration weighed down on the U.S. dollar in 2017. The strengthening of the euro was also reflected on the domestic market with a faster depreciation of the Seychelles rupee against the currency as compared to 2016. Such dynamics was also observed in the USD/SCR rate as the domestic currency depreciated against the USD, although to a lesser extent than the euro. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2017,724,Sierra Leone,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is floating, as the exchange rate of the leone is market determined. The BSL does not target a specific level of the exchange rate. Occasionally, it buys or sells foreign exchange in the market to build up its reserves and sells to the market as part of its open market operations through the foreign exchange auction. The CB intervention is limited to smoothen volatility. Effective May 10, 2017, the BSL suspended the wholesale foreign exchange to support the rebuilding of reserves. The foreign exchange auction data is published on the BSL website. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed."
2017,576,Singapore,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. The authorities manage the exchange rate as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the objective of maintaining price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. The Singapore dollar is allowed to fluctuate within a targeted policy band and is managed against a basket of currencies of the countryʹs major trading partners. Currencies in the basket are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the countries in Singaporeʹs trade relations with the world. The exchange rate policy is announced every six months in the Monetary Policy Statement, typically in terms of changes to the slope, central rate, and width of the policy band. In response to changing macroeconomic conditions, the policy parameters may also be adjusted outside the regular biannual cycle. The U.S. dollar is the intervention currency. In 2017, the Singapore dollar remained stable within a 2% band against a currency composite. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS) intervenes through agents and does not publish information on its interventions."
2017,936,Slovak Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. The Slovak Republic participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."

2017,813,Solomon Islands,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate regime pegs the Solomon Islands dollar (SBD) to a basket of currencies. The policy aims to ensure price stability and maintain a managed exchange rate policy in line with economic fundamentals and offer some flexibility. In May 2014, the Central Bank of the Solomon Islands (CBSI) revised the exchange rate management policy that modifies the exchange rate formula applied to implement the exchange rate policy pegging the SBD to an invoice-weighted basket of currencies. The aim was to (1) ensure that daily management of the exchange rate follows the basket peg more closely to achieve a constant and stable exchange rate; (2) ensure that the currency peg does not lead to real exchange rate misalignment (overvaluation, etc.) in the presence of inflation differentials with the Solomon Islandsʹ trading partners; and (3) review the merits of widening the current band of ±1% to ±1.5% around the base parity of the bilateral (SBD–U.S. dollar) exchange rate in order to benefit more fully from the advantages of a basket peg. The SBD per U.S. dollar value is the value of the index multiplied by the SBD per U.S. dollar value on the day the basket peg was introduced. The exchange rate (midrate) is now expressed in SBDs per U.S. dollar and is determined by the total index of the basket multiplied by the initial base rate expressed in SBDs rather than U.S. dollars, as was done previously. The midrate is announced as the official rate. The bank removed the band ?1% and +1% in October 2014 to allow greater flexibility in the basket movements. The bank maintained its exchange rate policy of pegging against the basket of currency index after removal of the band and allows intervention to the basket when necessary."
2017,726,Somalia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The currency of Somalia is the Somali shilling (SOS). However, the de facto currency is the U.S. dollar. Dollar banknotes are used as cash currency with Somali banknotes serving as a sub-denomination. Mobile phone payments, with transactions denominated in U.S. dollars, are widely used. Most transactions are settled in U.S. dollars. Neighboring country currencies are also used in border areas. From December 2014 to March 2016, the SOS/U.S. dollar exchange rate depreciated by 12.4%, mostly owing to an influx of new counterfeit notes. Since April 2016, the SOS/U.S. dollar exchange rate has remained stable (at about SOS 23,000 per U.S. dollar). The de jure exchange rate arrangement is undetermined. Due to the absence of administrative measures controlling the level of the exchange rate, and the inoperative status of the CBS in the foreign exchange market, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a free floating arrangement."
2017,199,South Africa,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free-floating. The exchange rate of the rand is determined by market forces (i.e., demand and supply) in the foreign exchange market. The South African Reserve Bank (SARB) has a publicly announced foreign exchange policy of purchasing foreign currency in the local foreign exchange market when market conditions permit. The main objective for conducting spot purchases is to accumulate foreign exchange reserves. However, in certain exceptional cases, the SARBʹs involvement in the spot market is aimed at facilitating the smooth functioning of interbank foreign exchange market, e.g. when there are relatively large foreign direct inflows into the country. In implementing its foreign exchange policy, the SARB does not seek to influence the level of the exchange rate. The SARB interacts with ADs as the price taker for official and commercial purposes. The market makers and brokers quote prices to other market participants; the SARB does not quote prices for market participants. The SARB publishes the official gold and foreign exchange reserves on a monthly basis including a statement explaining aggregate changes in reserves. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2017,733,South Sudan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"In mid-December 2015, the authorities introduced a de jure floating exchange rate regime, which led to an 84% depreciation of the exchange rate. Under the new regime, the Bank of South Sudan (BSS) supplies foreign exchange to commercial banks in auctions, and an indicative market rate is determined from the auction rate and the rate charged by commercial banks. All government transactions are carried out using the indicative market rate. The reform was successful in reducing the spread between the official/indicative and parallel exchange rates. The reform also included abolishing of exchange controls. However, excessive expansionary monetary policy has continued to exert downward pressure on the exchange rate and undermined convergence of the official and parallel rates. Since October 2017, the exchange rate stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to stabilized from other managed, effective October 23, 2017."

2017,524,Sri Lanka,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating since its introduction by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on January 23, 2001. The external value of the Sri Lanka rupee remained relatively stable, in 2017, under a more market-based exchange rate policy implemented by the CB during the year, limiting CB intervention in the foreign exchange market only to build up international reserves. The significant depreciation pressure on the rupee that prevailed particularly during the first two months of 2017 due to continued outflows stemming from import expenditure, debt service payments, and unwinding of foreign investments in the government securities market necessitated the CB to supply foreign currency liquidity to the domestic foreign exchange market to defend the external value of the Sri Lanka rupee. However, this situation turned around from March 2017, particularly with higher foreign investments to the CSE and the government securities market and increased conversion of export proceeds, which provided an opportunity for the CB to absorb foreign exchange liquidity from the market. The depreciation pressure on the rupee further eased gradually from May onward with the issuance of the ISB, the receipt of the foreign currency term financing facility, and disbursement of the third and the fourth tranches of the IMF EFF program, which helped improve investor confidence. This situation contributed toward the stability of the rupee against the U.S. dollar during the period from end-March to end-December 2017, even with some periods of gradual appreciation of the rupee amid substantial absorption of foreign exchange liquidity by the CB. With these developments, the rupee, which depreciated by 1.28% in the first quarter of 2017, recorded an overall depreciation of 2.00% against the U.S. dollar during the year, from Rs 149.80 at end-2016 to Rs 152.85 at end-2017. In addition, the annual average exchange rate depreciated by 4.50% to Rs 152.46 against the U.S. dollar in 2017. Meanwhile, the presence of the CB in the domestic foreign exchange market resulted in an absorption of US$1,664 million, on a net basis, in 2017. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2017,361,St. Kitts and Nevis,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Kitts and Nevis participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."

2017,732,Sudan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating. MFR used by commercial banks is determined in the interbank market, in which participants deal directly with each other. The CBOS participates in the market through swaps under a rules-based mechanism that triggers intervention if the exchange rate exceeds a band of ±4% around the previous dayʹs closing rate. The main objective of the policy is exchange rate stability. Sudanʹs multiple exchange rate regime includes (1) a CB rate that also applies to payment of government obligations and customs valuation. The rate of customs valuation is revised daily but not necessarily at CBOS rate;; and (2) an MFR used mainly by commercial banks and exchange bureaus. The MFR applies to all other transactions and has two components: (1) an indicative rate; and (2) a flexibility factor that allows banks to deviate from the average of the indicative rate and the incentive by a range of ±4%. The rate for collecting customs revenue changes daily. Since September 2016, the Sudanese pound has followed a depreciating trend against the U.S. dollar, punctuated by short periods of stability. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed from stabilized, effective September 8, 2016. The CBOS does not disclose information on its interventions to the public."
2017,366,Suriname,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. In accordance with a July 1994 presidential decree, the exchange rate is determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange. In February 6, 2016, the Central Bank of Suriname (Centrale Bank van Suriname, CBvS) announced that it would start conducting a weekly foreign exchange auction with commercial banks. On March 22, 2016, the authorities floated the currency based on a system of foreign exchange auctions aimed at ensuring a convergence of the official exchange rate to the market rate. On May 10, 2016, the CBvS authorized commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus to freely determine exchange rates. Since February 2017, the exchange rate has stabilized within a 2% band against the U. S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to “stabilized” from “other managed,” effective February 13, 2017."
2017,144,Sweden,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the krona is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are allowed under extraordinary circumstances (e.g., participation in concerted interventions with other CBs). Foreign exchange interventions were first introduced as a potential complementary measure January 4, 2016, at an extraordinary monetary policy meeting. At this meeting, the Executive Board of Sveriges Riksbank (SR) decided that the SR shall be able to intervene on the foreign exchange market as a complementary monetary policy measure if interventions are considered necessary to ensure that developments in the krona exchange rate do not constitute a serious risk that inflation does not stabilize around the inflation target in a satisfactory way. The SR announces its intervention in a press communiqué, explains the motive, and discloses the framework of intervention. However, no intervention has been reported since June 14, 2001. The foreign exchange intervention mandate has since January 4, 2016, been renewed continuously, without any intermission. The first mandate, introduced January 4, 2016, lasted until February 14, 2017. Effective February 14, 2017, the mandate was extended until October 24, 2017. Effective October 24, 2017, it was again extended until July 2, 2018. Effective July 2, 2018, the mandate was renewed to February 12, 2019."

The exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market. However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free-market rates. In 2017, the SNB intervened in the foreign exchange market to counter an undesired tightening of monetary conditions. These interventions occurred mainly at times of heightened uncertainty, when the Swiss franc was particularly sought after as a safe investment. Amid political uncertainty in the Eurozone, especially ahead of the French presidential election, the Swiss franc appreciated against the euro through spring 2017. After a turn in risk sentiment, the appreciation was reversed and the Swiss franc weakened in H2 2017. Since then, the trade-weighted exchange rate has remained broadly stable with temporary appreciation pressure during times of political uncertainty. This was particularly pronounced amid the Italian elections in Q2 2018. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual accountability report."
2017,463,Syria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Given the developments in the official rate, the emergence of the parallel market, and the intervention rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2017,923,Tajikistan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, with no predetermined path. The exchange rate of the somoni is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market, in which the NBT may intervene to limit exchange rate volatility. The NBT publishes monthly information on the scope of its transactions on the domestic currency exchange market in the Banking Statistics Bulletin, and in special press releases that are posted on the NBT website and other news media, in which explanations are provided of NBT policies undertaken to regulate the domestic currency exchange market. For purposes of regulating the exchange rate formation process on the cash segment of the U.S. dollar buy/sell market during a period of excessive fluctuation in the exchange rate, the NBT set a daily rate for purchases and sales of U.S. dollars in cash. The NBT canceled the procedure for setting rates for purchases and sales of U.S. dollars in cash and reinstated lending institutionsʹ right and authority to independently set these rates, on the condition that the selling rate may not be set higher than 1.5% of the official TJS (Tajik somoni) to U.S. dollar exchange rate (applied only in the cash segment of the domestic currency exchange market for retail transactions with the public). Effective April 8, 2017, the NBT lifted the procedure that requires the selling rate set by lending institutions to be no higher than 1.5% of the official TJS to U.S. dollar exchange rate. Previously, this rule applied in the cash segment of the domestic currency exchange market for retail transactions with the public. Effective October 1, 2017, the 1% and 1.5% margin limits for the sale of cash and noncash foreign currency by lending institutions were eliminated. Previously, a lending institution was allowed to sell foreign currency it purchases from its customers (intrabank transactions) or on the domestic interbank market at the exchange rate at which it was purchased plus up to 1% for noncash currency and up to 1.5% for currency in cash. Since May 2017, the exchange rate stabilized anew against the U.S. dollar after having depreciated by around 13.4% from February 2017. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified twice (1) to other managed from stabilized, effective February 13, 2017, and (2) to stabilized from other managed, effective May 24, 2017."
2017,738,Tanzania,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. Most recently, the Bank of Tanzania (BOT) has participated in the interbank foreign exchange market on both sides – selling and buying. The policy intention of selling U.S. dollars has been to sterilize liquidity generated by government spending of aid funds, while on the buying side – to build the reserves and inject domestic liquidity. BOT foreign exchange sales have varied depending on the liquidity in the economy and the amount and effectiveness of other monetary policy instruments. Trading in the interbank foreign exchange market is conducted using the Reuters trading platform in a two-way quote system. The BOT is not required to indicate two-way quotes when it participates in the interbank market. In 2017, the shilling stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as stabilized."
2017,578,Thailand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. Under the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the value of the baht is allowed to be determined by market forces, reflecting demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. In the case that the resulting movements in Thai baht (THB) are deemed excessive and unjustified by fundamentals, foreign exchange intervention can be undertaken. During 2017, the real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated at an increasing pace, resulting in 3.4% real effective appreciation and 9.6% nominal appreciation versus the U.S. dollar. The large current account surplus and sizable portfolio inflows were the main drivers, only partially offset by net outflows in FDI and other investment."
2017,313,The Bahamas,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg arrangement. The Bahamian dollar is pegged to the U.S. dollar at par.
2017,648,The Gambia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Gambia participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the dalasi and the U.S. dollar be maintained within ±15% of the central rate; however, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures. The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange to augment international reserves and ensure market orderliness. The dalasi has stabilized in a range between 43 and 46 dalasi per U.S. dollar. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed. The CBG does not publish intervention data. Effective June 1, 2017, the requirement for banks to sell 15% of their foreign exchange purchases was rescinded."
2017,537,Timor-Leste,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The U.S. dollar is legal tender and circulates freely.
2017,742,Togo,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Togo participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The monetary cooperation agreement (MCA) between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The MCA is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2017,866,Tonga,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. The external value of the paʹanga is determined on the basis of a weighted currency basket comprising the U.S. dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and Fijian dollar. The basket weights are determined based on the proportions of trade with trading partners. The weights are not published. The exchange rate of the paʹanga in terms of the U.S. dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily by the National Reserve Bank of Tonga (NRBT) within a band of ±5% a month. The NRBT does not publish intervention data. Under Section 34 of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act, the external value of the paʹanga is determined from time to time in a manner approved by the NRBT board, after consultation with the Minister of Finance and National Planning, in view of Tongaʹs obligations connected with international monetary agreements in which it takes part. Section 35(1) of the National Reserve Bank of Tonga Act empowers the NRBT to set the exchange rate."
2017,369,Trinidad and Tobago,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Over the period January 2017 to September 2018, the CBTT continued its regular interventions, and with no significant developments in the domestic foreign exchange market, the exchange rate has remained relatively stable. Because the Trinidad and Tobago dollar stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as stabilized. The CBTT routinely issues press releases on its direct intervention in the foreign exchange market."
2017,744,Tunisia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, as indicated on the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT—Banque Centrale de Tunisie) website. On April 18, 2012, a fixing arrangement (i.e., the average of market participantsʹ quotes) replaced the currency composite as the reference exchange rate published by the BCT. Since that time, the BCT has been using bilateral transactions to intervene in the foreign exchange market when market rates differ substantially from the dayʹs fixing rates, in order to smooth excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate for the dinar. Because the dinar has followed a depreciating trend against the euro, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to crawl-like from floating, effective May 19, 2017."
2017,186,Turkey,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lira is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Central Bank of the Republic of Turkey (CBRT) announced the general framework of the monetary and exchange rate policies envisaged for 2017 in a presentation titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2017” on December 6, 2016. The CBRT may intervene directly or through flexible auctions in the market in both directions, in case of unhealthy price formation due to speculative behavior stemming from a loss of market depth. In that case, the CBRT may buy or sell foreign exchange at the rates quoted by the banks directly. The results of the CBRTʹs daily auctions and volume of its interventions are published on its website. The CBRT introduced the reserve option mechanism (ROM) as a new monetary policy tool in 2011. In this framework, the CBRT allows banks to hold a fraction of their mandatory reserves for lira liabilities in foreign currency and gold. The CBRT may increase or decrease the reserve option coefficients (ROCs), the amount of foreign currency or gold required to meet one unit of Turkish lira required reserves (RR). Typically, the ROC is an increasing function of different tranches of lira RR; the tranches of the mechanism and the corresponding levels of ROC are determined by the CBRT. The ROM has been used as an active policy tool by the CBRT and has contributed to stabilization of capital flow volatility, indirectly influencing exchange rate movement. Given the CBRTʹs policy focus on limiting exchange rate volatility through the ROM, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2017,925,Turkmenistan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT) is responsible for exchange rate policy implementation. The Cabinet of Ministers of Turkmenistan (CMT) takes ultimate responsibility for economic policy decisions.

2017,746,Uganda,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The authorities intervene in Ugandaʹs foreign exchange market when short-term fluctuations jeopardize its orderly operation. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM) at the banksʹ quoted rates using the best bid-ask principle. The BOU publishes information on its interventions in its monthly, quarterly, and annual reports, including amounts purchased and sold through the reserve buildup program, interventions, and targeted transactions."
2017,926,Ukraine,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2018 and Medium Term (approved by the NBU Council September 21, 2017) call for the NBU to maintain a floating exchange rate arrangement, meaning that monetary policy will not be aimed at achieving a certain exchange rate target or range. At the same time, the NBU will use foreign currency interventions for the purpose of accumulating international reserves, smoothing out the functioning of the foreign exchange market, and maintaining the transmission of the key interest rate as the core monetary policy instrument. The main factors that had a significant impact on the exchange rate during 2017 were the trade blockade (and later the ban) of the territories not controlled by the government at the beginning of 2017; seasonal fluctuations associated with the receipt of revenues from exports of the agricultural sector, which mainly falls on the Q2; and the seasonal decline at the end of Q3 and Q4 coincided with more limited sales of foreign currency cash by individuals and substantial government expenditure (transfers), especially in December. In the first half of 2018, the supply of foreign currency in the domestic currency market prevailed over the demand, which allowed the NBU to buy foreign currency in order to accumulate international reserves. In August, due to the deterioration of expectations, the demand for foreign currency increased. To level out the foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the NBU sold US dollars in the foreign exchange market. The purchase and sale of foreign currency by the NBU was not aimed at changing the trend of the exchange rate formed under the influence of market forces."
2017,466,United Arab Emirates,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The dirham was pegged to the U.S. dollar in 1980. A January 2003 decision made the peg official. The United Arab Emirates Central Bank (UAECB) does not publish its intervention data.
2017,112,United Kingdom,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating. The exchange rate of the pound sterling is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of England (BOE) has a separate pool of foreign exchange reserves, which it uses at its discretion to intervene in support of its monetary policy objectives. A monthly press release issued by Her Majestyʹs Treasury (HMT) reports HMT and BOE intervention. There were no foreign exchange interventions during 2017."
2017,111,United States,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating; the exchange rate of the U.S. dollar is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are not formally ruled out in the United States, but they are rarely used. The secretary of the Treasury is responsible for the formulation and implementation of international monetary and financial policy, including foreign exchange market intervention policy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has separate legal authority to engage in foreign exchange operations, which are conducted in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury to ensure consistency with U.S. international monetary and financial policy. The Treasury and the Fed have closely coordinated their foreign exchange operations since early 1962, when the Fed commenced such operations at the request of the Treasury. Operations are conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as fiscal agent of the United States and as the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. Interventions are announced when they occur and the size of the interventions is reported in the Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations quarterly bulletin. U.S. authorities last intervened in the foreign exchange market in March 2011, following the earthquake in Japan, in a coordinated G7 effort to sell Japanese yen. The United States did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2017."
2017,298,Uruguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the peso is determined on the basis of supply and demand, although the CBU reserves the right to intervene to cushion abrupt changes in a concentrated market of few transactions. The intervention currency is the U.S. dollar. The CB periodically intervenes in the exchange market to smooth excess exchange rate volatility. The CBU publishes information on intervention on its website."
2017,927,Uzbekistan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Uzbekistan is floating. The exchange rate is determined based on supply and demand for foreign currency on Uzbekistanʹs currency exchange. The Central Bank of Uzbekistan (CBU) is a direct buyer of monetary gold produced in Uzbekistan, acting as supplier in the foreign exchange market in amounts equivalent to the volume of gold purchased from producers. The CBU also intervenes in the foreign exchange market to smooth out undue short-term volatility. Foreign exchange sales by the CBU in the foreign exchange market are not directed at affecting fundamental trend of the exchange rate and are driven exclusively by the aim of sterilizing additional liquidity from the CBU purchases of monetary gold. The sum–U.S. dollar exchange rate is used as an operational benchmark, since the vast majority of the countryʹs trading operations are carried out in U.S. dollars. In September 2017, Uzbekistan unified its exchange rates. As a result, the official exchange rate fell from 4,250 to 8,100 UZS/USD. Since then, the sum has stabilized against the U.S. dollar within 2% band. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified as stabilized from a crawl-like arrangement, effective September 6, 2017. One of the significant seasonal factors affecting the supply of foreign exchange is remittances from abroad. The volume of remittances is relatively higher in the second and third quarters of the calendar year. Data on the CBU interventions are published on the CBU website in quarterly “Survey of the Domestic Exchange Market” publications."
2017,846,Vanuatu,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Since 1988, Vanuatu has officially maintained an adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement. Currently, the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a transaction-weighted (trade and tourism receipts) basket of currencies whose weights and composition are not publicly disclosed and are adjusted periodically. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed, because the composite weights are not disclosed and cannot be confirmed, and, in practice, the vatu has been slightly more volatile against a composite than the 2% band typical of stabilized or pegged arrangements."
2017,299,Venezuela,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate is a conventional peg against the U.S. dollar. Effective February 14, 2018, the Complementary Floating Market Exchange Rate (DICOM) is the single official exchange rate in Venezuela. The DICOM rate is determined through an auction system. Article 28 of the Exchange Agreement No. 39 indicates that the exchange rate to be used by public and private sectors for all settlement operations in foreign currency will be the DICOM exchange rate. The DICOM rate stood at Bs/US$79,800 (buying) and Bs/US$80,000 (selling) on May 29, 2018. In addition to the official DICOM exchange rate, there is a parallel market that is widely used by the private sector and individuals. As of May 30 2018, the parallel EXR stood at 1,684,848 bolivars per dollar, according to BolivarCucuta; at 1,614,820 bolivars per dollar according to AirTM; at 2,151,163 bolivars per dollar according to Cotizaciones. In comparison, DICOM was trading at only 80,000 bolivars per dollar during the same period. Previously, the following exchange rates existed. Since March 10, 2016, a fixed exchange rate called the Protected Exchange Rate (DIPRO) (Exchange Rate Agreement No. 35 published in the Official Gazette G.O. No. 40,865 on March 9, 2016) was set at Bs 10.000/US$ (selling) and Bs 9.975/US$ (buying). After the entry into force of Exchange Arrangement (EA) No. 35, the DIPRO rate of exchange was applied to the acquisition of foreign currency for the importation of the goods determined by the Ministries of Industry and Commerce and of Banking and Finance—with the previous opinion of the Vice-presidency of the Republic and the Venezuelan Central Bank (in English: VCB or in Spanish: BCV—Banco Central de Venezuela) in lists of products and tariff codes of the food and health sectors and raw materials and consumable supplies associated with the production of the same. The DIPRO rate of exchange was applied to the foreign currency intended for conversion of pensions for old age, retirement, partial disability, incapacity, and survivors paid by the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security (Instituto Venezolano de los Seguros Sociales—IVSS) to persons residing abroad. Also, the DIPRO rate of exchange was applied to the foreign currency intended for expenses for recovery of health, sports, culture, scientific research, and other cases of special urgency defined in the exchange rules. The DIPRO rate was used for the payment of foreign public debt, and for the settlement of imports of goods published in the list of customs tariff codes, channeled through the Reciprocal Payments and Credits Agreements entered into with the CBs of the LAIA (in Spanish: ALADI) member countries, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, as well as the operating banks authorized to process transactions through the Unitary System of Regional Payment Compensation SUCRE. Variable exchange rates: There were additional four official exchange rates, namely: (1) The rate produced by the Complementary Foreign Exchange Administration System (Sistema complementario de administracion de divisas—SICAD) in special auctions or from securities denominated in foreign currencies issued through the system, which stood at Bs/US$13.15 at end-2015—no auctions were held in 2016 (Exchange Agreement (EA) No. 26 of April 3, 2014 published in G.O. No. 40,391 of April 10, 2014). (2) The rate derived from the Alternative Foreign Exchange System (SICAD II), which corresponds to the weighted average of purchase and sales operations in foreign currency or securities denominated in foreign currencies, conducted on a daily basis through this system. However, it should be noted that SICAD II operations were suspended February 12, 2015, therefore the applicable exchange rate is the rate from the systemʹs last trading session published on the website of the BCV, which is Bs/US$51.9710 (buying) and Bs/US$52.1013 (selling). (3) The weighted average of purchase and sales operations in foreign currency or securities denominated in foreign currencies, conducted on a daily basis in highly liquid markets and in securities regulated under Exchange Agreement No. 33 of February 10, 2015, which stood at Bs/US$672.0772 (buying) and Bs/US$673.7617 (selling) at end-2016. Article 31 of the Exchange Agreement No. 39 establishes that the conversion of foreign currency for the determination of the taxable amount of tax obligations derived from customs operations will be carried out at the DICOM exchange rate in effect on the date of the operation. Article 33 indicates that the exchange rate to be used for foreign currency conversion for the determination of the amounts to be paid because of the customs and tax penalties regimes will be the DICOM exchange rate at the date of the corresponding sanction. The tax obligations established in special laws, as well as the rates, commissions, surcharges, and public prices that have been set in the corresponding regulations in foreign currency, may be paid alternatively in the currency in which they are denominated, in their equivalent in other foreign currency in accordance with the price published for that purpose by the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV), or in bolivars applying the complementary floating market exchange rate in force at the date of the transaction. (Exchange Agreement No. 39, Article 34). The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed."
2017,582,Vietnam,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Clause 2, Article 15 Decree No. 70/2014/ND-CP of July 17, 2014, clarifies the following: (1) The official exchange rate is determined based on demand and supply in the foreign exchange market under State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) regulations. The SBV regulates the exchange rate by deploying monetary policy instruments and intervening in the foreign exchange market. (2) The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, and is determined by the SBV based on a currency basket of countries with trade, financing, and investment relationships with Vietnam, consistent with macroeconomic targets of each period. Decision No. 2730/QD-NHNN specifies that the central exchange rate is announced daily, based on reference of the interbank-weighted exchange rate, exchange rate developments in global markets of some currencies that are of Vietnamʹs major investment, credit, and trading partners, monetary and macroeconomic balances, and monetary policy targets. In 2017, the dong remained stabilized within a 2% band against the U.S. dollar. The dong–U.S. dollar exchange rate might fluctuate around the average interbank foreign currency market exchange rate announced by the SBV within a daily transaction band of ±3%. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2017,474,Yemen,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been free floating since July 1996. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) receives most of the foreign exchange proceeds, particularly crude oil export revenues, official loans, and official development assistance. After an adjustment of 16.4% in April 2016, the official exchange rate has remained steady at about Yrls 250. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2017,754,Zambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The official exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The Bank of Zambia (BOZ) intervenes primarily through transactions with ADs, which are registered commercial banks that meet the prescribed eligibility criteria under the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market (IFEM) Framework. BOZ interventions are published as historical data, and its foreign exchange transactions are published in the biweekly statistics. In 2017, the domestic foreign exchange market was relatively stable with the Kwacha against the U.S. dollar exhibiting an appreciation bias during the first half of the year but weakened marginally toward the end of the review period. The market was generally awash with liquidity and the BOZ interventions were mostly to mop up excess Foreign Exchange from the market. The market was predominantly influenced by liquidity from mining companies as well as from foreign financials who were converting to meet quarterly tax payments and investing in domestic Government Securities, respectively."
2017,698,Zimbabwe,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The Zimbabwean dollar is no longer used as the domestic currency for economic, financial, and administrative purposes as of February 2009. The Zimbabwean dollar demonetized through Statutory Instrument 70 of 2015, gazetted on June 12, 2015; the process lasted from June 15, 2015, to September 30, 2015. The purpose of demonetization of the local unit was to promote consumer confidence and business confidence by providing credibility to the multicurrency system and legally retiring the Zimbabwean dollar. Statutory Instrument 133 of 2016, Presidential Powers (Temporary Measures) Amendment of the Reserve Bank of Zimbabwe Act, empowered the RBZ to issue bond notes and bond coins, at parity with the U.S. dollar, to alleviate the domestic liquidity conditions. The statutory instrument prescribes that a tender of payment of bond notes and coins issued by the RBZ are exchangeable at par value with any specified currency prescribed as legal tender in Zimbabwe and shall be legal tender in all transactions in Zimbabwe. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed."
2018,512,Afghanistan,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Da Afghanistan Bank (DAB) intervenes regularly in the foreign exchange market through three-times-weekly selling auctions. The results are published on the DAB website. The DAB deals with ADs only through the auction. The primary goal of these auctions is to regulate the growth of reserve money and/or currency in circulation. Subject to meeting this goal, the DAB also seeks to minimize intra-auction exchange rate volatility. Since May 2018, the exchange rate increased its volatility against the US dollar, while still being managed. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to “other managed” from “crawl-like,” effective May 4, 2018. The DAB publishes intervention data on its website."
2018,914,Albania,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the lek is based on supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The BOA is not usually active in this market. In accordance with its regulations, intervention is limited to the following situations: (1) calming a disorderly market, which arises because of seasonality and lack of market depth. Interbank market bid-ask spreads, total market turnover, and speed of one-way moves are taken into consideration when intervening to calm a disorderly market. Excess volatility in the domestic foreign exchange market is considered on a case-by-case basis by the Committee for Implementing and Advising the Monetary Policy. The BOA uses auctions only for the purpose of accumulating foreign exchange reserves. This practice has been communicated to the banks. During 2019, the BOA plans to modify the framework of the auctions and increase the transparency of the process from the decision making to the individual auction announcements. When the BOA intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market, its counterparties are the commercial banks; if necessary, it may carry out its intervention with foreign exchange bureaus. The BOA intervenes through (1) verbal intervention, in the form of press releases in the print or electronic media and/or press conferences; and (2) transactional intervention. The latter can take two forms, direct intervention and intervention via preannounced auctions. In the case of direct intervention, the exchange rate is determined by commercial banksʹ quotes and the BOA Monetary Operations Departmentʹs quotes. When the intervention exchange rate is uniform for all counterparties, the BOA publishes that rate on its Reuters page and simultaneously communicates the rate to commercial banks that do not participate in the Reuters system and to foreign exchange bureaus with which it has contact. When different exchange rates are used, the BOA announces only the fact that it has intervened. It publishes with a three-month lag the amount of the intervention in a quarterly bulletin that summarizes its foreign exchange operations with banks and the public sector. The regulation regarding foreign exchange interventions includes the option to carry out transactional interventions via auctions announced in advance. The BOA announces the date, amount, and currency it wants to buy at least one month before the auction, and the banks submit one bid each (in an amount equal to the limit it has provided the BOA). The BOA decides how much to buy based on the rates offered and its target amount. Following the auction, the BOA publishes the amount offered by commercial banks, the amount accepted by the BOA, the range of offered bids, the range of accepted bids, and the prorate at the maximum accepted bid. Swaps with the central government constitute an indirect intervention channel. The BOA aims to avoid disruptions from large and irregular demand of foreign exchange by MOF, to better manage liquidity. The domestic currency experienced a sharp appreciation in the second quarter of 2018. The lek has experienced trend appreciating pressures over the past three years, on account of recovering macroeconomic fundamentals: improved external trade balances, high FDI inflows, and reduced risk premia in domestic financial markets. However, the episode of abrupt appreciation of Q2 2018 was driven by idiosyncratic foreign exchange market factors: a temporary oversupply of foreign exchange in the market engendered one-sided expectations toward further appreciation, resulting in severe market disruption and a rapid appreciation of the lek exchange rate. The BOA estimated that the rapid appreciation of the exchange rate would impede on its ability to achieve its inflation target over the medium term and might potentially induce financial instability. Against this backdrop, the BOA lowered its policy rate by 0.25 percentage points in June 2018. Given limited room for further cuts and ongoing foreign exchange market disruption, the BOA used domestic foreign exchange market intervention as a temporary and ad hoc monetary policy tool, in conjunction with its price stability mandate, to restrain the abrupt pace of lek appreciation. On deciding the intervention, the SC of the BOA relied on the “deviation from fundamentals” clause prescribed in the Regulation on Interventions. From an internal point of view, the intervention was guided from strict operational guidelines, that sought to: (1) make sure the intervention would be subjugated to the monetary policy goal of price stability, through striving to avoid the risk of deflation; (2) discipline and minimize the frequency and amount of intervention; (3) transparently communicate to the market the reason of intervention (that is, avoid confusion with our regular schedule of auctions, which is the traditional instrument employed to raise reserves); and (4) provide a clear line of communication and oversight by the Supervisory Council, who is ultimately in charge of deciding monetary policy in Albania. The amount purchased through these operations is counted in assessing the adequacy of our foreign exchange reserves and, thus, from a medium term perspective, it will not have any impact on the BOA holdings of foreign exchange reserves. From an external point of view, the BOA did transparently communicate the reasons for interventions underlying these operations. In particular, it communicated: (1) These operations would be considered exceptional, in as much as they were undertaken given limited space for monetary policy to react through its conventional toolkit; (2) they would be limited in scope and duration; and (3) they did not imply changes in neither the monetary policy nor the exchange rate regime. The interventions had an immediate impact in controlling the pace of exchange rate appreciation and in promoting orderly trading activity in the foreign exchange market. The pace of the appreciation has moderated in 2019 diminishing risks for inflation undershooting the objective in the medium term. In 2018, the exchange rate has appreciated by almost 8% against the euro because of large tourism inflows, FDI, remittances, an increase of borrowing in euros by a large public company, and the Merger and Acquisition (M&A) activity in the banking system, leading to capital conversation from euros to lek in a number of banks. The speed of the appreciation and the level by itself have been considered by BOA staff and further on by SB in big misalignment from the fundamentals and with the possibility of creating strong and permanent deflationary situation. After the decision of the Board, the BOA has intervened in the foreign exchange market up to mid-October 2018 for monetary policy purposes. These interventions have been conducted following specific procedures approved by the Board. During 2018 and so far in 2019, the BOA has continued to accumulate reserves following a preannounced calendar of auctions. During 2018, the BOA has bought 424.10 mio euros, including 116.20 mio euros purchased directly from the European Bank for Reconstruction and Development (EBRD). So far as of July 18, 2019, the BOA has bought 71.40 mio euros through the auctions. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2018,612,Algeria,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. The Bank of Algeria (BA) does not announce the path of the exchange rate. The external value of the dinar is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the BA is the main seller. This is because of significant inflows related to commodity exports, including hydrocarbons, which, under current law, must be surrendered to the BA. The BA manages the dinar with reference to a basket of currencies, and the rate of the dinar relative to the currencies in the basket is based on balance of payments data. The BA has not set a target range for fluctuation of the dinar outside or within any particular band, and the observed exchange rate movements do not confirm any constant weights of the currency composite. Since June 2018, the exchange rate followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the US dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to crawl-like from other managed, effective June 15, 2018. The BA does not disclose information about its interventions."
2018,614,Angola,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating; however, the BNA closely monitors exchange rate fluctuations, possibly to try to maintain price stability in the economy, and frequently intervenes in the foreign exchange market by holding foreign exchange auctions. The BNA receives foreign exchange from the taxes paid by oil companies to the government, and buys foreign exchange from oil companies that make payments to residents for services provided to them in kwanza. Effective January 1, 2018, the BNA adopted a regime of (unannounced) bands for the fluctuation of the kwanza against the euro, and conducted two auctions under the system that led to significant depreciation of the kwanza. To stem exchange rate overshooting, the BNA then set a new foreign exchange auction system in which bids could fluctuate within a plus/minus 2 percentage point band around the average exchange rate of winning bids of the previous auction, de facto capping the maximum depreciation of the exchange rate at 2% per auction. This cap has been abandoned in December 2018, but the BNA can still limit the daily changes in the exchange rate through arbitrarily classifying certain bids in auctions as “speculative” and removing that bid from the auction. Since January 2018, the exchange rate has increased its volatility, while still being managed. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to “other managed” from “stabilized,” effective January 9, 2018. The BNA publishes the auction results and respective reference rates."
2018,311,Antigua and Barbuda,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Antigua and Barbuda participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been close to 100%."
2018,213,Argentina,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the peso, which is determined in the MULC (Mercado Único y Libre de Cambios—Local Foreign Exchange Market) by supply and demand, applies to all transactions in foreign exchange and foreign currency banknotes. All individuals and legal entities, equity concerns, and other estates may operate freely on the foreign exchange market through authorized institutions, without making the distinction by the type of operation and/or residence of the customer. Notwithstanding the above, the BCRA reserves the power to operate in the exchange market to manage its balance sheet and prevent unjustified fluctuations in the exchange rate. In 2018, there was a reversal in capital flows that generated greater financial volatility. Between March and June, the first episode of exchange rate turbulence spread. In that period, the monetary authority sold a total of US$11.439 million. The second event occurred between August and September, with peak volatility occurring on August 30, when the exchange rate registered an increase of 24%. In these months, the sales of dollars made by the CB totaled US$4.495 million. As a result of these episodes of repeated nominal instability, effective October 1, 2018, the BCRA adopted a new monetary-exchange scheme and defined Zones of intervention and non-intervention, within which the peso could float freely. Initially, the non-intervention zone limits were defined at $34 and $44 per dollar, adjusted daily at a rate of 3% per month until the end of 2018. If the exchange rate were above the upper limit, the BCRA could intervene through bids for the sale of dollars for a fixed daily amount, while if the exchange rate breached the lower limit, bids for the purchase of dollars for a fixed daily amount could be made. From October to the end of 2018, the exchange rate stabilized within the non-intervention zone, although close to the lower limit. Although the exchange rate depreciated 50.3% during the year, there has been an appreciation of 8.2% since the implementation of the new monetary-exchange scheme in October. During the first quarter of 2019, the non-intervention zone limits were updated daily at a monthly rate of 2%, using the existing limits as of December 31, 2018, as a benchmark. During January and much of February, the exchange rate operated close to the lower limit of the non-intervention zone, falling below it on several occasions. This led the CB to make foreign exchange purchases from the market for US$978 million between January 10 and February 13, in accordance with the mechanism established in the monetary regime. The adjustment of the non-intervention zone limits was 1.75% per month in the first half of April. Effective April 16, 2019, it was decided that the adjustment would be 0% for the rest of the year (keeping the lower and upper limits constant at 39.755 and 51.448 pesos per dollar, respectively) and, effective April 29, 2019, it was established that, because of the increase in exchange volatility, discretionary interventions could be made within what would become known as the Reference Zone (between 39.755 and 51.448 pesos per dollar) and that, if the exchange rate were above the upper limit, a total of US$250 million could be sold, maintaining the possibility of increasing this amount if deemed necessary. Additionally, the BCRA decided that it would not buy foreign exchange if the exchange rate breached the lower limit of the Reference Zone until July. As of July 1, 2019, the reference exchange rate (Communication “A” 3500 Wholesaler) was A$42.135 per US dollar, within the Reference Zone and the BCRA has not intervened in the market since February 13. Exchange rate intervention data can be consulted in the Daily Monetary Report. In turn, the CB issues special communiqués when it purchases dollars from the Treasury. Both the latter and the Daily Monetary Report can be consulted on the CBʹs website. The Daily Monetary Report publishes intervention data on net purchases from the private sector and the National Treasury on a daily basis. Exchange intervention data are published with a 3-day delay (taking into account working days) because of the time required for the correct processing of the information prior to its dissemination."
2018,911,Armenia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The CBA intervenes in the foreign exchange market only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility, defined as short-term, high-frequency exchange rate movements caused by speculative or trend-following elements rather than underlying macroeconomic fundamentals. The CBA intervenes anonymously mainly via auctions of foreign exchange, or openly in the interbank market, or through the stock exchange. The CBA publishes weekly intervention data through the stock exchange only on its website every Monday and publishes daily foreign exchange auction results on the local interbank platform. Because the exchange rate has stabilized within a 2% band against the US dollar since January 2017, de facto exchange arrangement was reclassified retroactively to stabilized from floating, effective January 2, 2017. The de facto methodology for classification of exchange rate regimes is based on a backward-looking statistical approach that relies on past exchange rate movement and historical data. Therefore, this reclassification does not imply statements or views on future or intended policies nor does it imply a policy commitment on the part of the country authorities."

2018,193,Australia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"Both the de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as free floating. However, the Reserve Bank of Australia (RBA) retains discretionary authority to intervene in the foreign exchange market and has done so during periods of significant market disorder and/or gross misalignment of the exchange rate. Given the high level of development of the Australian foreign exchange market, interventions have been rare. The most recent period of intervention was in 2007–08 and was in response to episodes of significant market disorder—that is, instances when market functioning was impaired to such a degree that it was clear that the observed volatility was excessive. The RBA may also vary the way intervention is conducted; it may enter the interbank foreign exchange market directly through voice or electronic brokerage platforms or use an agent bank. As a matter of government policy, most wholesale purchases of foreign currency by government agencies are made through the RBA. The RBA manages the flows from purchases on behalf of the government so as to minimize their market impact—for example, by executing these trades when the market is liquid and, if necessary, breaking up the required purchases into a series of smaller transactions. Monthly purchases and sales of foreign exchange are published on the RBA website. Daily data on foreign exchange market interventions are published on the RBA website annually, following the release of the RBA Annual Report."

2018,912,Azerbaijan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"On January 12, 2017, the Central Bank of Azerbaijan (CBA) announced a change of the de jure exchange rate arrangement to a free floating from a managed floating arrangement and eliminated the requirement for banks to buy or sell foreign currency at a range of no more than 4% from the official exchange rate. The exchange rate of manat rests on fundamental factors determining the supply and demand ratio in the foreign exchange market. Under this decision, the CBA initiated a new currency auction mechanism, while limits on fluctuation of the market currency exchange rate compared to the official rate were eliminated. The new auction mechanism is organized on the unilateral basis, in which the CBA provides the auctionʹs operational platform, and the State Oil Fund of Azerbaijan. Currency has realized on the basis of offered prices by the market players. This mechanism implies selling currency to the customer offering the higher price at the first place. The amount of the currency to be offered at an auction will be announced in advance. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The CBA publishes its foreign exchange intervention data quarterly."

2018,913,Belarus,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The National Bank carries out a flexible exchange rate policy that provides for minimizing currency interventions in the medium term to smooth out sharp fluctuations in the exchange rate. Currency interventions are used to reduce the daily volatility of the exchange rate, and not for regulating its level. In accordance with the Republic of Belarus Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2019, with a sustained excess supply of foreign currency in the domestic exchange market, the National Bank purchases foreign currency to replenish international reserves. Because the NBRB has not followed a currency basket since August 2018, the de facto exchange rate arrangement has been reclassified to floating from other managed, effective August 1, 2018.

2018,218,Bolivia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of the Plurinational State of Bolivia is a crawling peg to the US dollar (also called a “sliding” rate) and is characterized by small exchange rate movements that are not announced in advance. The Central Bank of Bolivia (CBB) determines the floor price for the daily competitive foreign exchange auction (“bolsín”) in which the financial private sector and the nonfinancial private sector as well participate. The CBB ensures that the exchange rate is consistent with moderate inflation, thus mitigating external and internal inflationary pressures, because the exchange rate is still used as a benchmark for the prices of nontradable goods, albeit to a decreasing extent because of bolivianization (dedollarization) in real and financial transactions. The exchange rates used in most exchange transactions fluctuate daily within a band of 12 centavos (1.7%), defined by the official buying and selling exchange rates (Bs. 6.86 and Bs. 6.96, respectively) plus a margin of one centavo at each end. Because the boliviano stabilized against the US dollar since November 2011, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The authorities consider that the de facto stabilized arrangement does not fully reflect the exchange arrangement managed by the CBB because the official policy of a crawling peg has not changed. The CBBʹs crawling peg mechanism allows the sliding rate to be set at zero without changing the arrangement if the underlying economic fundamentals warrant it. The CBB publishes information on its exchange market interventions and on its foreign exchange purchases and sales in the “Weekly Statistics” section and in other publications such as the Monthly Statistical Bulletin, all of which are available on its website."

2018,616,Botswana,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as a crawling peg. The official exchange rate of the pula is determined according to a weighted basket of currencies comprising the SDR and the South African rand. The crawl rate is set as the difference between the Bank of Botswanaʹs (BOBʹs) inflation objective and the inflation forecast in major trading partner countries. The crawl rate is thus determined using a forward-looking approach and is revised regularly. In this approach, the authorities periodically determine the crawl rate for the subsequent period, such as the next 6 or 12 months. The weights of the basket are 45% for the South African rand and 55% for the SDR. Effective January 1, 2018, a downward rate of crawl of 0.3% (previously an upward rate of crawl of 0.26%) an annum was adopted, while the weights of the pula basket remained unchanged. Effective January 1, 2019, an upward rate of crawl of 0.3% (previously a downward rate of crawl of 0.3%) an annum was adopted, while the weights of the pula basket remained unchanged.

The floating band of the RMBʹs trading prices is 2% against the US dollar in the interbank foreign exchange market—that is, on each business day, the trading prices of the RMB against the US dollar in the market may fluctuate within a band of ±2% around the midrate released that day by Chinaʹs Foreign Exchange Trading System (CFETS). The Peopleʹs Bank of China (PBC) announced that the RMBʹs floating range would be expanded in an orderly manner, based on the developments of the foreign exchange market and economic and financial situation. Based on the market demand and their pricing capacity, banks can determine their quotes of RMB against other currencies. There is no limit on the purchasing and selling prices of spot exchange and cash, which are determined by market supply and demand (PBC No. 2014/188). Since June 2018, the RMB increased its volatility against the basket of 24 currencies included in the CFETS index. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed from crawl-like, effective June 22, 2018.

Effective September 28, 2018, the Board of Directors of the Banco de la República (BR) decided to implement a program of gradual accumulation of international reserves via monthly auctions of put options. This program began on October 1, 2018, and was suspended on June 4, 2019. The reserve accumulation put options may be exercised when the representative market rate (RMR) falls below its recent average (average for the preceding 20 business days). The amounts of the auctions are announced in the invitation. The participants pay a premium set via the uniform price auction mechanism. The option exercise exchange rate is the RMR in effect on the day the option is exercised. Entities that comply with Regulatory Circular DODM 143 participate in this program. The BR publishes daily data on interventions on the exchange market. The BR publishes the date, amount, and mechanism. When an intervention involves options, the information is published on the day that the option is exercised. Each month (on the fifth business day) the BR publishes a press release indicating the amount purchased or sold in the previous month (aggregate monthly amount). Exchange rate performance in 2018 was affected by the dollar/monetary policy outlook in the United States, periods of volatility in emerging market economies, and oil price developments. The peso appreciated at the start of 2018 in line with the increase in oil prices but subsequently weakened in response to uncertainty about the presidential elections, dollar strength, and emerging market turbulence. In 2019, the performance of the Colombian peso was consistent with that of other emerging market currencies, particularly other currencies in the region. Its performance is explained primarily by the general performance of the US dollar in response to monetary policy changes in that country. Other factors that have affected the exchange rate include pressures of trade negotiations on global growth, oil price developments, and reports of economic weakness in some European countries. Locally, the Colombian peso has been influenced by the uncertainty regarding the level and possible increase of the current account deficit and the likelihood of meeting the fiscal targets in the short and medium term. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2018,632,Comoros,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The Comoros participates in the franc zone area. The Comorian franc is pegged to the euro at the fixed rate of CF 491.96775 per euro; the value of other currencies is based on this fixed rate and on the exchange rates of these currencies in the foreign exchange markets. The exchange rate arrangement is established by the following documents: (1) the monetary November 23, 1979, cooperation agreement between the Comorian and French governments; (2) the November 23, 1998, decision by the European Council of Ministers authorizing France to maintain its monetary arrangements with the CFA area countries and the Comoros; and (3) the January 14, 1999, order of the governor of the Central Bank of Comoros (CBC) on euro–Comorian franc parity. Decree No. 87-005/PR, Regulating Financial Relations between the Comoros and Other Countries and its regulations apply. The government of either the Comoros or France may change the exchange rate arrangement after notification to the other party."
2018,238,Costa Rica,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, on February 2, 2015, under Article 5 of the legal act adopted during session 5677-2015 of the Board of Directors of the BCCR held January 30, 2015. Under this arrangement: (1) the BCCR allows the exchange rate to be freely determined by foreign currency supply and demand, but it may participate in the market to meet its own foreign currency requirements and those of the nonbank public sector (NBPS) and, at its discretion, to prevent drastic fluctuations in the exchange rate, in such a way that these actions will not interrupt the trend determined by the macroeconomic variables of that price (sterilization interventions); (2) the BCCR may carry out direct operations or use foreign currency trading instruments that it deems appropriate, in accordance with current regulations. Three episodes are identified in the exchange market throughout 2018. First, relative stability was observed in the first half of the year, a period during which a cumulative change of ?0.48% and a year-on-year change of ?0.98% were recorded at end-December 2017, where the net supply of foreign exchange by the private sector made it possible to meet the Sector Público No Bancario (SPNB) requirements. Exchange tensions arose between July and November as a result of various factors: (1) a private market with a seasonally lower surplus; (2) the change in the position of the government, which switched from being a supplier to a net demander of foreign exchange; (3) higher oil prices (until October); (4) the fiscal uncertainty, which increased economic operatorsʹ preference for savings instruments in foreign currency and for credits in domestic currency; and (5) the resulting increase in the exchange rate and exchange expectations, which accelerated the predilection for savings in dollars and credits in colones, intensifying the above effects. The CB intervened with currency sales to avoid wild fluctuations in the exchange rate and to meet the SPNB requirements. Between July and November, the net cumulative result of private-sector operations (“windows”) was a deficit of US$6 million (surplus of US$928.9 million in the first half). At November, the CBʹs currency sale amassed US$415.5 million for stabilization and US$1,224,200,000 for SPNB operations. This situation changed in December. The exchange rate pressures diminished and the “windows” of foreign exchange dealers amassed a surplus of US$65.6 million, exchange variation expectations adjusted downward, and the CB was able to replenish in Monex some of the foreign currency sold to the SPNB in previous months. The latter, connected to the currency sale through the MOF, allowed for the reduction of the foreign exchange shortfall for operations with the SPNB from US$1,224,200,000 at November 30 to US$322.1 million at end-2018. The MOF sold to the CB some of the resources from the placement of internal debt (including placement contracts), external credit disbursements, and other foreign exchange income, most of which was received in December. As a result of all of these movements, the Monex average exchange rate posted a year-on-year change of 6.9% (2.5% in 2017). Contrary to what was observed in the second half of 2018, there were no stress events in the exchange market in the first half of 2019. During this period, foreign exchange dealersʹ operations with the public (“windows”) posted a cumulative surplus of US$812 million that, while lower than that which was posted at the same time the year before (US$928 million), enabled the CB to meet the SPNB foreign exchange requirements and partially replenish the currency sold to that end in previous periods. That surplus was particularly high for the second quarter (higher than that recorded during the same period in previous years), enabling authorized foreign exchange dealers to increase their foreign exchange position (FXP) by US$180.2 million in the second quarter and US$256 million in the first half of the year. The increased availability of foreign currency was reflected in greater exchange rate stability (in relation to the second half of 2018), tending downward. The average exchange rate in the foreign currency market (Monex) exhibited a cumulative change of ?6.48% and a year-on-year change of 0.33% at July 31, while for the same period in 2018, these benchmarks were ?1.07% and ?0.35%, respectively. Between January 2 and July 31, 2019, the BCCR sold a net amount of US$65.5 million for stabilization purposes, which is close to the amount posted one year earlier (US$73.8 million). The BCCR publishes its intervention data on a daily basis right after the Monex trading session closes. Given the increased volatility and departure from the 2% band against the US dollar in end-August 2018, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to “floating” from “crawl-like,” effective August 21, 2018."
2018,662,Côte dʹIvoire,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement of the WAEMU is a conventional peg. Côte dʹIvoire participates in a currency union with seven other members of the WAEMU and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement between the WAEMU member countries and France was concluded December 4, 1973. It was maintained after the French franc was replaced by the euro by the Council of the European Union decision of November 23, 1998. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement is based on three pillars: (1) a common issuing institution, (2) fixed parity with the euro, and (3) a guarantee of unlimited convertibility. In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO September 20, 2005."
2018,960,Croatia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating without a predetermined path. The Croatian National Bank (CNB) may set intervention exchange rates, which it applies in transactions with banks to limit exchange rate volatility. The CNB conducts foreign exchange auctions on a discretionary basis to ensure the stability of the kuna and provide liquidity for payments domestically and abroad (described under Section H.1.a.3. Auction). Since April 2016, the kuna has stabilized within a 2% band against the euro. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. Intervention data (prices and volume) are published on the CNB website."

2018,935,Czech Republic,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of koruna is solely determined by supply and demand in the interbank foreign exchange market, in which the Czech National Bank (CNB) might participate. On April 6, 2017, the CNB removed its cap on the koruna, allowing it to appreciate beyond CZK 27.0 to the euro. Data on CNBʹs foreign exchange operations are published on the CBʹs web page with a monthly frequency. However, the CNB is legally allowed to conduct foreign exchange interventions to influence the koruna exchange rate and moderate excessive exchange rate volatility in exceptional situations. Also, the CNB might in the future renew its program of sales of a part of the CNBʹs investment income on international reserves. These sales were suspended in November 2012 prior the introduction of exchange rate cap in November 2013. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2018,636,Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC),974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Congo franc is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The BCC intervenes through an auction, which is the only operational framework for the BCCʹs transactions with the market. Since January 2018, the exchange rate has stabilized within a 2% band against the US dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to stabilized from other managed, effective January 3, 2018. Information on foreign exchange market interventions is published on the Internet in the BCC bulletin."
2018,128,Denmark,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The formal framework for the Danish fixed exchange rate policy is the ERM II. Denmark participates in the ERM II with a central rate of DKr 746.038 per €100. The central rate is a conversion of the central rate vis-à-vis the deutsche mark before the third stage of the EMU and was last adjusted in January 1987. Denmark has entered into an agreement with the ECB and the euro area member countries on a narrower fluctuation band of ±2.25%. In recent years, the Danmarks Nationalbank (DN) has consistently maintained a stable krone within less than 1% of the central rate. The DNʹs net purchase or sale of foreign currency during a month is published at 4:00 p.m. on the second working day of the following month in the Foreign Exchange and Liquidity press release. The agreement on Denmarkʹs fixed exchange rate policy vis-à-vis the euro within a narrow fluctuation band of ±2.25% around the central rate in ERM II was concluded at an informal meeting of the Economic and Financial Affairs Council  (ECOFIN Council) of September 25–27, 1998, in Vienna, between the ministers of economy and finance and the CB governors of the EU member countries."
2018,611,Djibouti,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"Djiboutiʹs monetary system is based on a currency board. The Djibouti franc has been pegged to the US dollar since 1949, but the legislation establishing the currency board and determining the fixed exchange rate is Law No. 118/AN/11/6ème L of January 22, 2011. The Central Bank of Djibouti (BCD) guarantees and provides for unlimited conversion to US dollars of banknotes and coins used as legal tender in Djibouti. The full issuance of Djibouti francs is covered by foreign exchange reserves. The National Assembly of Djibouti has the authority to make decisions regarding changes in the exchange rate arrangement."
2018,321,Dominica,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. Dominica participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves.

2018,243,Dominican Republic,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed float. The Central Bank of the Dominican Republic (CBDR) aims to increase gradually the flexibility of the exchange rate alongside the implementation of the inflation-targeting framework formally adopted in 2012. The CBDR does not pursue a particular fixed exchange rate level, but rather seeks to manage a pathway around its long-term equilibrium value, consistent with the fundamentals of the Dominican Republic economy and its inflation target. The CBDR intervenes in the foreign exchange market to avoid instances of excessive exchange rate volatility that might affect the inflation target given that the exchange rate pass-through remains high. Since February 2010, the peso has followed a depreciating trend against the US dollar within a margin of less than 2%. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBDR publishes data on foreign exchange sales and purchases in the foreign exchange market by different institutional actors (financial intermediaries and remittance/foreign exchange agents). The data are published on a gross (all transactions) basis and a net basis (excluding interbank operations). The CBDR does not disclose data on its volume of foreign exchange transactions with financial intermediaries."
2018,248,Ecuador,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is an arrangement with no separate legal tender. The US dollar is the currency of Ecuador, which is freely circulating. All transactions and monetary and financial operations, as well as the relevant accounting records, executed in Ecuador must be denominated in US dollars in accordance with Articles 43 and 94 of the Monetary and Financial Organic Code. The circulation, exchange, withdrawal, and destruction of US dollars, which is legal tender in Ecuador, must be the exclusive power of the CBE, in accordance with the provisions established in this Code and the regulations prepared by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulation Board. Article 95 provides that the CBE and, in exceptional cases provided by the Board, institutions in the private financial system must be required to meet demand for liquidity in the Republic of Ecuador in a timely manner to ensure that economic transactions are carried out in accordance with the regulations issued by the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulation Board. For that purpose, they must be authorized to carry out any remittances that may be required, that are not to be considered import or export operations. Such operations carried out by the CBE may not be subject to any tax in the country. Under the legal mandate provided by the Organic Law for Economic Recovery, Strengthening of Dollarization, and Modernization of Financial Management, on December 29, 2017, the CBE proceeded to close the electronic money accounts and to issue the balances to their holders. (1) The CBEʹs power to implement and administer electronic currency was eliminated (See Article 14(21), Article 94 of the Monetary and Financial Organic Code). (2) It is established that electronic payment mechanisms will be implemented and operated by entities in the financial system (See Article 101 of the Monetary and Financial Organic Code). (3) It is ordered that all credit operations must be credited through the national payment system by electronic fund transfer or other electronic payment mechanisms (See Article 194(12), Paragraph (a)). Against this backdrop, effective February 14, 2018, the Monetary and Financial Policy and Regulation Board issued Resolution No. 441-2018-M “Regulation for Management of Electronic Means of Payment” establishing a section on management of the “Mobile Payment System” defined as the transfer of funds originating from a cellular telephone associated with an account with an institution in the national financial system to make and receive payments.

2018,469,Egypt,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. On November 3, 2016, the CBE announced its decision to move, with immediate effect, to a liberalized exchange rate regime to quell any distortions in the domestic foreign currency market. Pursuant to the above, banks and other market participants are at liberty to quote and trade at any exchange rate. Bid and ask exchange rates are determined by forces of demand and supply. The CBE uses the prevailing market rate for any transactions it undertakes. While the exchange rate appears to have increased its flexibility from January 2019, more observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as stabilized. The CBE does not publish intervention data."

On January 1, 2001, the US dollar became unrestricted legal tender with unlimited redeemability for the settlement of debt in El Salvador. The US dollar is used as a unit of account and a medium of exchange. The Central Reserve Bank (CRB) must exchange colones in circulation for US dollars at banksʹ request at a fixed and unalterable exchange rate of C 8.75 per US dollar.

2018,915,Georgia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements of Georgia are floating. The National Bank of Georgia (NBG) intervenes in the foreign exchange market through foreign exchange auctions, but does not make any explicit or implicit commitment with respect to an exchange rate target or path. Considering the market conditions, interventions are aimed at filling international reserves. Net purchases of the NBG totalled US$197.5 million. In 2018, the economic environment in trading partner countries improved substantially, which resulted in an increased demand for Georgian exports and led to significant improvement in current account deficit. Particularly, exports of goods and services (especially, tourism) increased considerably. Moreover, money transfers rose substantially. During the year, the nominal effective exchange rate experienced episodes of both appreciation and depreciation. Overall, in December 2018, the nominal effective exchange rate gained 8% on an annual basis. Meanwhile, the real effective exchange rate appreciated by 3.4% on a year-on-year basis. The amount bought/sold at NBGʹs foreign exchange auctions and the average exchange rates are posted on the NBG website the same day, shortly after each auction. Effective January 31, 2019, the NGB introduced a new instrument – Foreign exchange options. The main goal of using foreign exchange options is filling the international reserves. Foreign exchange option is a financial instrument, which gives the right to a holder (but not obligation) to buy national currency in exchange for foreign exchange (USD or EUR) during the predetermined period at the official exchange rate. The condition of using the options is that the lari exchange rate should be stronger than the average of previous 20 days. The press release about the foreign exchange interventions is published on the day of the auction and also in the statistics section of the NBG website. Data on the sale of the foreign exchange options are published the same day in the statistics page of the NBG. Tentative calendar for the following months is also available."

2018,652,Ghana,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the cedi is determined by market forces. Ghana joined the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the cedi and the US dollar be maintained within a margin of ±15% around the central rate. However, the authorities have yet to implement these measures. The BOG does not publish information on its interventions. During 2018, portfolio rebalancing by foreign investors led to the repatriation of coupons and principal from the local bond market. Despite large foreign exchange sales by the BOG, the cedi depreciated by around 9% against the US dollar in 2018, with most of the volatility occurring in H2 2018. Some factors impacting exchange rate in 2018 included the following: (1) Impact of Fed interest rate hike (2) Increased foreign exchange demand from manufacturing, corporate, and energy-related sectors (3) Coupon repatriation (4) Concerns about MTN IPO on the cedi (5) Cocoa syndicated loans."

2018,258,Guatemala,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange arrangement is floating. In accordance with the Monetary Law and the Currency Convertibility Law, Guatemala has a flexible exchange rate arrangement under which the rate is determined in the foreign exchange market by supply and demand. However, the Bank of Guatemala (BOG) may intervene in the foreign exchange market to limit volatility in the nominal exchange rate, without affecting its trend. The BOG intervenes through foreign exchange auctions based on a transparent rule, which limits daily volatility. The fluctuation band (added to or subtracted from the moving average exchange rate from the past five days) used to determine whether the BOG can participate in the foreign exchange market is 0.80%. The maximum amount of daily currency purchases or sales is US$40.0 million, which served to adjust the amounts auctioned to the increased volumes traded on the foreign exchange market. The BOG may also intervene when the nominal exchange rate shows unusual volatility, but this instrument has only been used once (during the international financial crisis). The BOG continued to intervene on the foreign exchange market to limit nominal exchange rate volatility without affecting its trend. The BOGʹs intervention on the foreign exchange market during 2018 led to net foreign exchange purchases of US$750.5 million under the intervention rule and purchases of US$455.9 million under the international reserve accumulation mechanism, placing the BOGʹs net intervention at US$1.206.4 billion, equivalent to 2.53% of the total traded on the foreign exchange market (5.59% in 2017). While the international monetary reserve accumulation mechanism has part of foreign exchange policy since 2014, it had not been used until 2018 (during the first five months of the year and between August 17 and October 31). This mechanism was incorporated into monetary policy to reduce the surplus of foreign exchange on the foreign exchange market and to strengthen the countryʹs external position, when feasible, and specifically to address any challenges that may arise from adverse international economic cycles in which the BOG might be required to use its foreign exchange reserves to dampen excessive exchange rate volatility to prevent the adverse effects of this volatility from being transmitted into economic activity and prices. Intervention data are available on the BOGʹs website. The nominal exchange rate at September 30, 2018, had registered a depreciation of 4.87% year on year, as indicated, in connection with the shift in the fundamentals, that had been on the rise until August 2017. The shift observed in the performance of the exchange rate for the quetzal against the US dollar can primarily be explained by three factors. The first is associated with the flow of foreign exchange in connection with household remittances, that registered a mitigated growth rate during 2018, unlike the three preceding years. The second factor is the increase in the value of imports beginning in 2017 deriving from the growth in fuel and lubricants as well as other imports as a result of the recovery in international oil prices, that led to lower levels of oil bill savings in 2015 and 2016. The third factor relates to the decrease in the value of exports during 2018 attributable to the decline in the international prices of some key export goods, as well as to a reduced export volume of some products from the extractive industries. However, during fourth-quarter 2018, the growth rate in household remittances accelerated, closing out the year with a growth rate of 13.4%, outstripping the rates observed throughout most of the year, although, falling short of the previous yearʹs performance. In addition, the decline observed in international oil prices led to substantially lower levels of growth in fuel and lubricant imports, as against the levels observed during the first nine months of 2018. In general, although these factors did not lead to any change in the fundamentals as indicated, they did impact the foreign exchange market through increased supply and reduced demand for foreign exchange, inducing some exchange rate stability during the latter part of the year. Because the exchange rate followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the US dollar from January 2018 and stabilized since September 2018, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified twice: (1) to crawl-like from a stabilized arrangement, effective January 17, 2018, and (2) to stabilized from a crawl-like arrangement, effective September 26, 2018."
2018,656,Guinea,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating. Guinea announced its participation in the exchange rate mechanisms (ERM and ERM II) of the WAMZ, which formally limits the fluctuation of the franc to ±15% around a central rate vis-à-vis the US dollar, but this has yet to be implemented. The BCRG replaced the previous weekly foreign exchange allocation with a biweekly competitive auction, reflecting market demand for foreign currency. The BCRGʹs intervention policy is based on a budget of foreign exchange sales. Banks are allowed to negotiate freely foreign exchange sales and purchases with their clients. The BCRG regularly publishes information regarding foreign exchange market interventions. Since July 2017, the Guinean franc has stabilized within a 2% band against the US dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."

2018,336,Guyana,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The exchange rate of the Guyanese dollar is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of Guyana (BOG) periodically purchases foreign currency from foreign exchange dealers to maintain international reserves at acceptable levels. In accordance with bilateral agreements with the CARICOM CBs, the BOG quotes weekly rates for certain CARICOM currencies. Reflecting the stability of the Guyanese dollar against the US dollar as a result of interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The CB publishes interventions on a monthly basis on the BOG website – “Statistical Abstract Reports Table 2.16 (a).” This data is published on a one month lag."
2018,263,Haiti,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Bank of the Republic of Haiti (BRH) intervenes in the foreign exchange market to avoid excessive volatility. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The BRH publishes information on foreign exchange interventions weekly on its website.
2018,268,Honduras,159,III.C.5.,Crawling peg,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as a crawling band. The exchange rate for the lempira is determined with the weighted average of the results of the last foreign exchange auction and the last interbank foreign exchange market (MID) event. The Central Bank of Honduras (BCH) requires bids for the purchase of foreign exchange at auction to be within a band of 1% above and below the average base rate prevailing at the seven previous auctions. (Resolution No. 293-6/2019 of the BCH.) In addition, in accordance with Resolution No. 140-3/2019, which stipulates the guidelines for selecting successful bids in BCH foreign exchange auctions, only bids greater than or equal to the TCR from the previous day will be eligible for selection, and when this value exceeds the foreign exchange band ceiling, only bids submitted at the ceiling of the foreign exchange band will be eligible for selection. The base price is calculated on a weekly basis, in accordance with a procedure established by the Board of Directors of the BCH for that purpose, which includes the following variables: (1) the differential between the domestic and external inflation rate; the external inflation rate is defined as the weighted average estimated inflation rates of Hondurasʹs key trading partners; and domestic inflation will be measured with the consumer price index (CPI). The inflation differential will be determined by comparing the year-on-year change in the CPI recorded during the past month with external inflation weighted to reflect the external trade structure, to be subject to periodic review; (2) the nominal effective exchange rate index, that is, changes in the exchange rate of the key trading partners against the US dollar; and (3) international reserve coverage, number of months of imports covered by the official reserve assets of the BCH. The BCH publishes the results of the foreign exchange trading carried out in the foreign exchange auction and on the MID on a daily basis at its website."
2018,532,Hong Kong SAR,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. The currency board system in Hong Kong SAR, adopted October 17, 1983, requires that the monetary base be backed at least 100% by, and that changes in it be matched 100% by corresponding changes in, the reserve currency (US dollar) at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per US dollar. A symmetric convertibility zone of HK$7.75–HK$7.85—within which the Hong Kong Monetary Authority (HKMA) may choose to conduct market operations consistent with currency board principles—has been in place since May 18, 2005. The monetary base includes issued notes and coins, the balance at the HKMA of banksʹ clearing accounts (that is, the aggregate balance), and outstanding Exchange Fund bills and notes. Consistent with currency board principles, the HKMA may issue additional Exchange Fund paper when there is an inflow of funds, and the program may expand along with the interest payments on such paper. The issuance and redemption of certificates of indebtedness, which back banknotes issued by note-issuing banks (NIBs), must be made against US dollars at a fixed exchange rate of HK$7.80 per US dollar. The issuance and withdrawal of government-issued notes and coins are settled against US dollars at the same fixed rate. The legal documents that establish the currency board include the Basic Law (Chapter V, Section 1, Articles 110 and 111); the Exchange Fund Ordinance (Chapter 66); and an exchange of letters between the Financial Secretary and the Monetary Authority specifying the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system under the Exchange Fund Ordinance. The letters specify that the Financial Secretary is responsible for determining the monetary policy objective and the structure of the monetary system, including the linked exchange rate. Section 3(1) of the ordinance, as amended, specifies that the Exchange Fund “must be under the control of the Financial Secretary and must be used primarily for such purposes as the financial secretary thinks fit affecting, either directly or indirectly, the exchange value of the currency of Hong Kong SAR and for other purposes incidental thereto.” The HKMA is responsible for achieving the monetary policy objective, including determining the strategy, instruments, and operational means for doing so, and for maintaining the stability and integrity of the monetary system. The HKMA makes immediate announcements of the impact on the aggregate balance because of purchases or sales of US dollars by the currency board via various information vendors, including Reuters and Bloomberg. The information is also available on the HKMA website."
2018,944,Hungary,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating because of discretionary intervention by the Magyar Nemzeti Bank (MNB) in the foreign exchange market. The general aim is to avoid disruptive market fluctuations and exchange rate overshooting. However, the MNB emphasizes that the Bank generally refrains from intervening in the foreign exchange market. The MNB converts foreign currency for the government and net current and capital transfers from the EU at market rates. These transactions change the foreign exchange reserve position of the MNB. If the resulting reserve dynamics are not in line with the MNBʹs reserve management objectives, the Bank will take the necessary measures. In 2018, the MNB accumulated about 4 billion euro in reserves, in part because of a high inflow of EU funds. The MNB does not publish intervention data."
2018,176,Iceland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. CBI intervention in the foreign exchange market has preserved exchange rate flexibility and maintained reserve adequacy while countering disorderly market conditions. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. The CBI publishes monthly data on its interventions in the foreign exchange market.
2018,534,India,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the rupee is largely market determined, but the Reserve Bank of India (RBI) intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange market to manage excessive volatility and maintain orderly conditions without any fixed target or band for the exchange rate. The RBI publishes monthly data on its interventions (foreign exchange purchases and sales) in its monthly bulletin with a six-week lag."
2018,536,Indonesia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating (adopted August 14, 1997). The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. BI, however, may intervene—as part of a policy mix—whenever necessary to achieve the inflation target and to maintain macroeconomic stability. When it intervenes, the BI does not target a specific rate or maintain exchange rate movements within a specific band; rather, it provides liquidity to maintain market stability. In 2018, tighter global financial conditions resulted in episodes of exchange rate pressures and capital outflows from Indonesia, which was relatively hard hit compared to other emerging markets in Asia. External pressures have subsided since October 2018 and inflows have resumed, although they remain volatile. The current account deficit widened to 3%of the gross domestic product (GDP) in 2018 (from 1.6% in 2017), mainly because of lower commodity exports and higher infrastructure-related imports. Tighter financial conditions during Q2/Q3 2018 led to an overall decline in net portfolio and FDI flows by 1.6% of GDP relative to 2017. Overall, the balance of payments reached a deficit of 0.7% of GDP, with the current account deficit more than offsetting the financial account surplus. Gross international reserves declined by 0.9% of GDP to US$121 billion (6½ months of imports) in December 2018, from US$130 billion at end 2017. Given the increased volatility and departure from the 2% band against the US dollar since January 2018, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from stabilized, effective January 1, 2018. The BI does not disclose data on its interventions."
2018,433,Iraq,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg arrangement. The Central Bank Law gives the Board of the Central Bank of Iraq (CBI) the authority to formulate exchange rate policy. From January 2, 2017, the cash and transfer exchange rate was set at ID 1,184 plus ID 6 (fees) per US dollar. Effective May 24, 2018, the official exchange rate was set at ID 1,190 per US dollar including CBI commission which represent the cash and transfer selling price in the window for buying and selling foreign currency. Banks are allowed to deal at a maximum exchange rate of ID 1,200."
2018,178,Ireland,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Ireland participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2018,429,Islamic Republic of Iran,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement has been a managed floating arrangement against a basket of currencies since 2002. Effective April 10, 2018, the official and parallel exchange rates have been unified. All foreign exchange transactions are to be conducted via banks using a new electronic trading system. Transactions occurring at rates other than the unified rate will be subject to penalties under the Anti-Smuggling Law. A New Integrated Foreign Exchange Transactions System “NIMA” was launched on April 11, 2018, aiming to facilitate the currency trades for market participants. CBIʹs NIMA platform operates to regulate foreign exchange transactions by enabling exporters to sell foreign currencies to exchange houses who must then on-sell the currency to importers of goods and services with a valid import/services registration order in place. The price of each transaction is agreed between importer and exporter as well as banks and bureaus, creating a market exchange rate. Since August 2018, the exchange rate stabilized within a 2% band against the US dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to stabilized from crawl-like, effective August 7, 2018. Foreign exchange bureaus were reopened."
2018,436,Israel,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. However, the Bank of Israel (BOI) may intervene in the foreign exchange market in the event of unusual movements in the exchange rate that are inconsistent with underlying economic conditions or when conditions in the foreign exchange market are disorderly. The BOI purchased US$3.3 billion in the foreign exchange market during 2018 (US$6.6 billion in 2017 and US$6.04 billion in 2016), of which US$1.50 billion (US$1.5 billion in 2017 and US$1.8 billion in 2016) was part of the purchase plan to offset the effect of natural gas production on the exchange rate and the rest was under the foreign exchange policy announced in August 2009. The BOI announced, effective December 11, 2018, the end of the foreign exchange purchasing program meant to offset the effects of natural gas production on the exchange rate. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a floating arrangement. The BOI publishes monthly purchase information."

2018,343,Jamaica,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the Jamaican dollar is determined in the domestic foreign exchange market, in which the Bank of Jamaica (BOJ) intervenes occasionally with sales and purchases of foreign currency. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The BOJ intervenes occasionally via market auctions. Intervention is done on both sides of the market. The BOJ publishes a four-week-ahead schedule of expected interventions and the results of its interventions on the day of the intervention via auction. The results are also published in its Annual Report and Quarterly Monetary Policy Report, with a two-month lag. To improve the transparency in the market, the BOJ, since mid-2019, has published all transactions over US$100,000 and the rate at which these transactions were consummated. Since January 2018, the exchange rate has been mainly impacted by demand for foreign exchange by firms wanting to capitalize on the low interest rate environment. In this regard, some firms have been paying down foreign currency debt to replace it with local debt. Further, more firms have entered the bond market by floating foreign currency bonds to finance new investments or expansions. On occasions, net demand for foreign currency will emerge for current account purposes. For example, the September quarter generally exhibits a seasonal low in flows. However, the current account of the BOP is assessed to be sustainable and continues to show a surplus after abstracting for the impact of foreign direct investments which do not generate demand from the local foreign exchange market."
2018,158,Japan,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the yen is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. However, the authorities intervene when necessary to counter disorderly conditions in the market. The principal intervention currency is the US dollar. Interventions fall within the mandate of the MOF, which publishes daily purchases and sales amounts as well as intervention currencies on its website. The BOJ, acting as agent of the minister of finance, intervenes in the market through financial institutions and/or brokers. The last time the MOF intervened in the foreign exchange market was from October 31 through November 4, 2011 (¥9,091.6 billion), to address excess volatility and disorderly exchange rate movement. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as free floating. The MOF publishes monthly data on foreign exchange interventions in its monthly press release."
2018,439,Jordan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional pegged arrangement. The dinar is officially pegged to the SDR, but in practice, it has been pegged to the US dollar since late 1995. The CBJ is responsible for maintaining the stability of the dinar exchange rate."
2018,916,Kazakhstan,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. In 2019, the exchange rate of the tenge is influenced by internal and external factors. External factors include the price of oil and the dynamics of trading partnersʹ currencies, primarily the Russian ruble. In 2019, the exchange rate of the tenge fluctuated between 373.56 and 384.53 tenge to the US dollar. Since the beginning of the year, the exchange rate of the tenge to the US dollar strengthened by 0.9% (as of June 20, 2019, it was 380.56 tenge to the US dollar). This was due largely to favorable conditions in the global oil market and positive changes in external accounts. The trade surplus in the first quarter of 2019 grew to $7.1 billion (+14.4%). During this period, the currencies of Kazakhstanʹs trading partners also showed a strengthening against the US dollar–the Russian ruble strengthened by 9.1% (during the same period). The National Bank of Kazakhstan (NBK) publishes monthly data on foreign exchange interventions on a regular basis, with time series available from January 1996. Data are usually published within two weeks from the end of the reporting period. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2018,664,Kenya,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. Kenya pursues a flexible exchange rate regime where the value of the Kenya shilling is determined by the market according to the demand and supply of foreign exchange. Official foreign exchange market interventions aim to moderate the rate of change and prevent undue fluctuations in the exchange rate, rather than to establish a particular level. The observed increase in volatility during the first quarter of 2019 was because of higher than expected inflows of diaspora remittances, tourism, and horticultural export receipts. The de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to other managed from stabilized, effective October 31, 2018. Data on interventions are not published."

2018,542,Korea,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the won is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. As such, the system is managed in accordance with the principles defined by the free floating system, and the governmentʹs role is very limited to remain within the range allowed by the free floating system. However, because of the lack of information on the authoritiesʹ interventions, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The Bank of Korea (BOK) may intervene in the market with the funds of the BOK and the Foreign Exchange Equalization Fund when it is deemed necessary for the stability of the market. Interventions in the spot market or through derivatives in the forward market are not announced, but intervention data in net terms are published. The Korean government and the BOK (the foreign exchange authorities) are implementing their disclosure in two stages. In the first stage, information is disclosed on a semiannual basis, no later than three months after the end of each six-month period. Specifically, information for the period of July to December in 2018 was disclosed March 29, 2019, and information for the period of January to June in 2019 was disclosed September 30, 2019. In the second stage, from July 2019 onwards, information will be disclosed on a quarterly basis, no later than three months after the end of the respective quarter. Specifically, information for the period of July to September in 2019 will be disclosed by the end of December 2019. Henceforth, information will be disclosed on an identical period and time basis.

Unless proven otherwise, such an agreement must be deemed to exist with regard to any foreign currency that is widely accepted in the Territory of Kosovo.” Administrative Direction No. 1999/2 of October 4, 1999, “Implementing UNMIK Regulation No. 1999/4 of 2 September 1999, On the Currency Permitted to be used in Kosovo” designated Deutschmark (DEM) as the only currency to formulate accounts and to perform compulsory payments. Later, because of the changeover of DEM into euro, Administrative Direction No. 2001/24 of December 21, 2001, “Amending Administrative Direction No. 1999/2 implementing UNMIK Regulation No. 1999/4 on the currency permitted to be used in Kosovo” replaced DEM by euro (1 euro = 1.95583 DEM)."

Official intervention focuses on building foreign reserves and limiting exchange rate volatility while taking into account seasonal fluctuations. Since August 2016, the kwacha has stabilized within a 2% band against the US dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement. The combination of seasonality related to trade flows (for example, tobacco exports) and foreign exchange intervention contributed to a stable exchange rate.

2018,273,Mexico,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating; the exchange rate of the peso is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Foreign Exchange Commission (FEC), comprised of members of the CB and the MOF, determines the foreign exchange rate policy. The FEC does not target or defend any exchange rate level. In January 2017, the FEC announced an intervention mechanism through a foreign exchange hedging program. The foreign exchange hedging is auctioned through non-deliverable forwards. The use of these forwards implies the settlement is in pesos. Currently, the FEC authorized up to US$20 billion of non-deliverable forwards. At its maturity, each outstanding amount must be rolled over under a roll-over auction until the FEC instructs otherwise. The data on interventions is published on the Bankʹs website immediately after the auctions. In particular, the CB discloses received and allocated bids, including the forward points, as well as the total amount demanded."
2018,868,Micronesia,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The currency of Micronesia is the US dollar. The authorities do not buy or sell foreign exchange.
2018,921,Moldova,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The NBM intervenes in the domestic foreign exchange interbank market to smooth out sharp exchange rate fluctuations of MDL against the US dollar. Sharp fluctuations are not specifically defined. However, the NBM intervenes based on market conditions and future expectations of market participants. These interventions do not aim to change the trend of the exchange rate determined by the market. The NBM intervenes directly at the market-quoted rates and publishes aggregated monthly data on its website regarding its interventions and interbank market turnover. The data shows interventions by currency and type of operation (spot or derivative). In 2018, foreign exchange inflows continued to exceed foreign exchange outflows but to a lower extent as compared to the previous years, given a stronger growth of imports as compared to exports, which led to a deterioration of trade balance by 30%, highest deficit being observed in Q4 (BPM6 data). Remittances continued to grow, but at a slightly slower rate as compared to 2017 (+12% against +13%). Regarding other balance of payments dynamics in 2018, there was a pickup in FDI, but at the same time, there were higher payments of dividends. These developments combined have contributed to a lower foreign exchange surplus liquidity on the internal market as compared to the post-banking crisis years. In 2018–Q2 2019, the domestic foreign exchange market, implicitly the exchange rate, was also affected by the local and general election phases (which took place in Q2 2018 and Q1 2019). The CB has performed most of its foreign exchange purchase interventions in Q1 and Q3, 2018, periods of higher foreign exchange surplus and respectively stronger appreciation pressures on the exchange rate. A part of CBʹs purchase interventions was related to reserve accumulation following FDI in 2018. The foreign exchange surplus on the domestic market is a common seasonal development for Q3, while in Q1, it was related to the appreciation of EUR and other main trading partner currencies against the US dollar (EUR is the main/preferred saving and remittance currency for Moldovan nationals). In Q2 2018, the CB has intervened occasionally to offset higher misbalances on the foreign exchange market, which would cause larger swings in the exchange rate, if left unresolved. In Q2 2018, the net foreign exchange demand from agents was partially for dividend payments, with pressures on the exchange rate being also because of the pre-election phase, which have incentivized businesses and consumers to temporarily hoard foreign currency. The same factors along with stronger demand for foreign exchange from energy importers persisted in Q4 2018–Q1 2019 prompting the CB to intervene with foreign exchange sales. In Q2 2019, the exchange rate of the MDL continued a normal depreciation path. At the same time, the CB has significantly reduced its presence in the domestic foreign exchange market. Aggregate monthly data on CBʹs transactions with the domestic banks is published. Data is available by gross amount, by currency and by transaction type. Data on CBʹs net foreign exchange interventions can be found in the press release on the evolution of official reserve assets, which is published by the 7th following the month for which the data is reported. The press release is available in Romanian and Russian (first hyperlink provided). More detailed data (second and third hyperlinks) is published by the 22nd following the month for which the data is reported."
2018,948,Mongolia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangements is floating. The BOM reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. The BOM intervenes through the auction to moderate the rate of change in line with macroeconomic fundamentals. Because of economic activation, in 2018, Mongoliaʹs imports rose by 36% to US$5.9 billion, an increase of FED policy rate resulted in lower foreign exchange inflow, and BOP showed deficit of US$141 million. As a result of these macroeconomic situations, exchange rate was 2643.69 at the end of 2018, incurring MNT appreciation of 8.9%. Subsequently, the BOMʹs intervention in the foreign exchange market through auction has increased drastically compared to previous year. In December 2018, the BOM has launched its foreign exchange trading platform to facilitate interbank foreign exchange trades and its foreign exchange auctions. The BOM publishes the cutoff rate for each auction on its website. Because the exchange rate followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the US dollar from September 2017 and has increased its volatility since April 2018, while still being managed, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified twice: (1) retroactively to crawl-like from floating, effective September 18, 2017, and (2) to other managed from crawl-like, effective April 11, 2018."

2018,686,Morocco,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate with horizontal bands vis-à-vis a composite, effective January 15, 2018, when the limit for the exchange rate band in relation to the central rate was increased to +/?2.5% from +/?0.3%. Previously, the exchange rate arrangement was a conventional peg. Since April 2015, the basket has been composed of the euro and the US dollar, with weights of 60% and 40%, respectively. The Bank Al-Maghrib (BAM) had published until November 5, 2018, its daily foreign exchange purchases and sales on its website. The BAM has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since March 2018. The authority to establish the fixed exchange rate arrangement is found in Dahir No. 1-05-38 of November 23, 2005, promulgating Law No. 76-03 establishing the charter of the BAM (Chapter II, Missions, Section I, Core missions, Article 8). The exchange arrangement falls within the purview and prerogatives of the Ministry of Economy and Finance. The BAM is responsible for its operational implementation (quoted rates, ranges) and any changes and monitors the foreign exchange market. Because the exchange rate has remained stabilized within a 2% band against the US dollar–euro basket, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to stabilized from a conventional peg arrangement, effective January 15, 2018."

2018,518,Myanmar,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a managed float. The CBM has no predetermined target for the level of the kyat exchange rate and expects the value to fluctuate with supply and demand in the market. In 2018, the CBM made progress in allowing market forces to play a bigger role in determining the exchange rate. The foreign exchange reference rate largely followed a formula consisting of a weighted average of foreign exchange interbank and bank-customer market rates, with occasional small deviations. The CBM also abolished the trading band (reference rate +/? 0.8%) in August 2018, which clarified the current system and should lead to an increase in the volume and representativeness of the formal market. The CBM issued February 4, 2019, a formal regulation announcing the market-based exchange rate as the new reference rate. Indicative cross-rates for certain other currencies are based on Thomson Reuters and the IMF website. The CBM reserves the right to intervene to moderate excessive exchange rate volatility in the foreign exchange market. The de facto exchange rate regime was reclassified to other managed from a stabilized arrangement, effective April 20, 2018."

The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) may intervene if the exchange rate is exceptionally high or low, if that rate is not justified by economic fundamentals, and if there is a material prospect that the intervention will influence the exchange rate. Interventions may not be used as an attempt to influence the long-term trend of the exchange rate. The RBNZ publishes information on its foreign currency assets and liabilities, including its foreign currency intervention capacity (stock of reserves available for intervention) and foreign exchange swap position, on its website but does not publish data on its direct intervention.

The exchange rate is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Norges Bank (NB) does not normally intervene to influence the exchange rate of the krone; however, it may intervene in the foreign exchange market on short notice if the krone deviates substantially from the level the NB considers reasonable in relation to fundamentals and if exchange rate developments weaken the prospect of achieving the inflation target. The NB may also intervene in response to pronounced short-term fluctuations in the krone when liquidity in the foreign exchange market falls to a very low level. The NB has not intervened in the foreign exchange market since January 1999. Foreign exchange purchases or sales for the Government Pension Fund Global are publicly preannounced on the CB website.

2018,288,Paraguay,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The exchange rate is determined by supply and demand. The objective of the CBP under Article 3 of Law No. 489/95 is to preserve and safeguard the stability of the currency and promote the efficiency and stability of the financial system. Article No. 47 states the following: “Within the framework of the National Governmentʹs economic policy and the laws, the Central Bank of Paraguay (CBP) shall administer the legal provisions and their regulations that set the exchange rate regime, as well as the control measures over current foreign collections and payments and capital movements that are only adopted by the Powers of the State in circumstances of exceptional national emergency. Foreign exchange operations shall be carried out on the free foreign exchange market which, for the purposes of this Law, is made up of entities authorized to operate in the foreign exchange market. Anyone may engage in foreign exchange operations. The exchange rate shall be that freely agreed on by the parties involved, in accordance with supply and the demand.” Article No. 50 establishes the following: “The Free Exchange Market shall operate with foreign currency and other documents, checks, drafts, or foreign exchange transfer securities derived from the export and import of goods, services, and capital movements, except in cases of specific prohibitions established by the Law or by provisions founded by the Executive Branch. The CBP shall operate in the foreign exchange market to ensure its normal, competitive, and balanced operation and to respect the fundamental trends in the supply and demand of foreign currency. Foreign currency trading by the CBP shall aim to mitigate the effects of seasonal fluctuations in supply and demand and offset erratic capital flows and speculative movements that could disrupt the market or the exchange rate.” The CBP, in its capacity as a financial agent of the government (Article 71 of its Organic Charter – Law No. 489), buys US dollars from the government, received by the latter in the form of royalties and compensation paid by the bi-national hydroelectric entities, in exchange for guaraníes. These dollars purchased from the public sector are returned to the market via sales to the financial system according to CBP announcements. On the second working day of each month, the CBP publishes daily data of exchange operations (with the public sector and with the financial sector) of the previous month on its institutional website. Additionally, operations are also published according to classification, either compensatory or complementary. In 2018, the CBPʹs net purchases with the financial system were US$ -1,273.1 million, while net purchases with the public sector were US$ 930.32 million. The highest level of foreign currency sales to the Financial Sector corresponds to the CBʹs effort to moderate the abrupt exchange rate volatility, without altering the market trend, taking into account the context of regional depreciation because of external shocks of rising international interest rates, the US-China trade war, and the increase in the risk level of emerging countries following the US sanctions imposed on Turkey in August. Since June 2018, the exchange rate followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the US dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to crawl-like from floating, effective June 11, 2018."

2018,566,Philippines,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Bangko Sentral ng Pilipinas (BSP) adheres to a market-determined exchange rate policy with some scope for occasional action solely to prevent potentially disruptive sharp fluctuations that may have an adverse impact on the inflation outlook. The importation season, which was around July to September, and the inflows because of seasonal remittances in the 4th quarter were taken into consideration in estimating the possible intervention amount. However, the BSP does not target or support a given level of exchange rate; it allows the value of the peso to be determined by the demand for and supply of foreign currencies. The BSP may participate in the US dollar–peso market directly with market participants or via market makers and does not disclose intervention data. Data on currency swaps settled in foreign currency and non-deliverable forwards (NDFs) settled in domestic currency are reported monthly in Sections II and IV, respectively, of the Data Template on International Reserves and Foreign Currency Liquidity, which is posted on the BSP website. In general, the peso was on an appreciating trend between January and July 2019 amid market optimism on positive developments in US-China trade relations and the dovish remarks from the US Federal Reserves. On a year-to-date basis, the peso appreciated against the US dollar by 1.20% to close at ?51.96/US$1 on August 6, 2019, from the end-December 2018 closing rate of ?52.58/US$1.

The Republic of Congo participates in the CEMAC and has no separate legal tender. The Monetary Cooperation Agreement (MCA) between CEMAC member countries and France is based on three principles: (1) a common CB; (2) fixed parity with the euro; and (3) an unlimited convertibility guarantee. Article 16 empowers the finance ministers of signatory countries (Joint Monetary Committee) to amend the MCA. Article 17 permits signatories to amend the agreement. Article 18 specifies that the expulsion of a member country from the BEAC automatically results in that countryʹs renunciation of the MCA.
2018,962,Republic of North Macedonia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. Under the Law on Foreign Exchange Operations (Article 33), the denar exchange rate is freely determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. This arrangement is still in place under the current legislation. However, the National Bank of the Republic of North Macedonia (NBRNM) participates in the foreign exchange market (Article 34), to achieve the goals determined with the monetary and the foreign exchange policies. The NBRNM is implementing the monetary strategy of targeting the nominal exchange rate against the euro, the intermediary objective of the monetary policy being the maintenance of the denar exchange rate stability. Thus, the NBRNM maintains a stable exchange rate within a narrow fluctuation band of bid-ask exchange rates determined by the Committee for Operational Monetary Policy. Size and direction of the interventions are published on a regular quarterly basis, in the Quarterly Report of the NBRNM (Balance of Payments section, Financial Account subsection, in the part commenting on the developments of the foreign exchange reserves).

2018,968,Romania,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating; the exchange rate of the leu is determined in the interbank foreign exchange market. The National Bank of Romania (NBR) may intervene to smooth excessive exchange rate fluctuations. There is no formal definition of excessive exchange rate fluctuations: the assessment is based on domestic and international market circumstances and on prevailing macroeconomic conditions. The NBR intervenes either directly with market participants at their quoted rates or via market makers. The NBR does not publish information on its interventions. From July 2016, the leu followed a depreciating trend within a narrow 2% band against the euro, and stabilized since January 2018 (with one realignment in January 2019). Therefore, the de facto ER arrangement was reclassified twice: (1) retroactively to crawl-like from floating, effective July 22, 2016; and (2) to stabilized from crawl-like, effective January 25, 2018. The de facto methodology for classification of exchange rate regimes is based on a backward-looking statistical approach that relies on past exchange rate movement and historical data. Therefore, this reclassification does not imply statements or views on future or intended policies nor does it imply a policy commitment on the part of the country authorities."
2018,922,Russia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating. Under this arrangement, the exchange rate of the ruble is determined by market factors. Following the transition to the free floating exchange rate arrangement, the BR retained the ability to intervene in the domestic foreign exchange market in the event of threats to financial stability. BR information about the frequency and volumes of the BRʹs foreign currency interventions is posted on the BRʹs website under the “Liquidity of the banking sector and monetary policy instruments” subsection of the “Statistics” section. Since 2017, the MOF implemented a new mechanism of foreign exchange purchases and sales to enhance the stability and predictability of local economic conditions and to reduce the impact of price volatility in the global energy market on Russiaʹs economy and public finance (budget rule). Trade volumes depend on the amount of oil and gas revenues of the federal budget. As long as the actual Urals price exceeds the benchmark oil price of US$40/bbl (in real terms, adjusted for US inflation), the MOF should purchase, through the BR, foreign exchange in the amount of additional oil and gas revenues. If the actual prices drop below this level, the MOF should sell foreign exchange in the amount of the resulting shortfall of oil and gas revenues. It was specified that the cumulative (from the beginning of operations) foreign exchange sales volumes should not exceed the cumulative purchase volumes. The size of these operations should be announced at the start of every month and purchases should be evenly distributed within the month. Effective January 1, 2018, only the current exchange rate is used to calculate the amount of foreign exchange purchase/sales. Previously the amount of foreign exchange purchases/sales took into account the difference between the current and budgeted exchange rates. Effective January 1, 2018, the condition that restricted the cumulative (from the beginning of operations) foreign exchange sales volumes not to exceed the cumulative purchase volumes was eliminated. From mid-August to end-2018, the BR suspended the purchase of foreign exchange under the budget rule with the aim of limiting exchange rate volatility and associated risks to financial stability. In comments on August 10, 2018, the BR reported that it could make an adjustment in the daily volume of foreign exchange purchased in the currency market through implementation of the budget rule mechanism. Effective August 23, 2018, the BR announced the suspension of foreign exchange purchases until end-September 2018, and effective September 14, 2018, it announced the suspension of foreign exchange purchases until end-2018. Effective December 14, 2018, the BR Board of Directors decided to resume purchases starting from January 15, 2019. It was announced that deferred purchases could be performed gradually throughout 2019 and subsequent years (these purchases began on February 1, 2019, and it is assumed that they will be carried out regularly over 36 months). The foreign exchange purchase program is preannounced, is predictable, involves small daily amounts, and is not triggered by an exchange rate level. Data on operations involving the purchase (sale) of foreign exchange performed by the BR on instructions from the Russian Ministry of Finance are published on the official website of the Bank of Russia on a daily basis in the Factors Affecting Banking Sector Liquidity table (under the column Operations of the Russian Ministry of Finance Involving the Purchase (Sale) of Foreign Exchange in the Domestic Exchange Market)."

Currencies included in the Samoan tala basket are the US dollar, New Zealand dollar, Australian dollar, and euro. Annual reviews of the currency weights in the Samoan tala basket reflect the payment pattern of Samoaʹs trade in goods and travel receipts in the previous calendar year. The Samoan tala fluctuates based on the movements of the currencies within the basket. The CBS stands ready to maintain the stability of the nominal value of the Samoan tala through a direct adjustment, if necessary and relevant. This is only considered when the authorities identify a significant adverse economic impact on the Samoan economy from any unforeseen major event (externally or domestically)."

In exchange for the unlimited convertibility of the CFA franc to euros, the WAEMU members are required to deposit 50% of their reserve holdings to the operations account with the French Treasury in accordance with the Amendment to the Operations Account Convention signed by France and the BCEAO on September 20, 2005."
2018,942,Serbia,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The current Decision on the Dinar Exchange Rate Regime stipulates “managed floating.” Since the introduction of this exchange rate regime in 2001 and in accordance with its commitment to liberalization of the foreign exchange market, the National Bank of Serbia (NBS) has tried to reduce its participation in the foreign exchange market and to adjust the features of the existing exchange rate regime in the direction of soft managed floating. This exchange rate regime enables the NBS to balance, when necessary, foreign exchange demand and supply and moderate excessive daily fluctuation of the exchange rate in either direction (appreciation or depreciation) that may occur under the influence of external or internal shocks to the national economy. Because the exchange rate has stabilized within a 2% band against the euro since March 2018, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to “stabilized” from “crawl like,” effective March 2, 2018. The de facto methodology for classification of exchange rate regimes is based on a backward-looking statistical approach that relies on past exchange rate movement and historical data. Therefore, this reclassification does not imply statements or views on future or intended policies nor does it imply a policy commitment on the part of the country authorities. The NBS publishes intervention data (amount purchased or sold) on its website on the same day when the interventions occur. This announcement is published at the end of working hours (usually before 6 p.m.). Also, the NBS publishes a spreadsheet with daily data on foreign exchange intervention (amount purchased or sold) quarterly when the Inflation Report is published, as part of the statistics related to the Inflation Report. Monthly aggregated intervention data (purchases plus sales) is published, approximately with a three-week time lag (there is a “Release Calendar” available on the same page)."
2018,718,Seychelles,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The rate of the rupee is determined by supply and demand in the market. The CBS intervenes only to smooth excessive exchange rate volatility. The CBS occasionally participates in the foreign exchange market for reserve accumulation. The CBS discloses intervention data to the IMF on a weekly basis. On average, the Seychelles rupee depreciated vis-à-vis the dollar and appreciated with respect to the euro in 2018. A strong tourism performance (both in terms of higher arrivals and spending) was observed in 2018. In addition, lower services imports and strong performance of tuna exports resulted in an improvement in the trade balance. Despite an increase in supply of foreign exchange in the economy relative to 2017, demand for foreign exchange remained strong. During 2018, the CBS intervened in the foreign exchange market for reserves accumulation purposes and purchased a total of US$21.5 million. The reserves accumulation exercise was necessary to maintain a stable level of international reserves. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2018,724,Sierra Leone,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, as the exchange rate of the Leone is market determined. The BSL does not target a specific level of the exchange rate. The foreign exchange auction data is published on the BSL website. Actual foreign exchange auction data is published as soon as the auction is concluded. Auction data includes amount offered, amount sold, and the auction weighted average exchange rate. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed."
2018,576,Singapore,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is other managed. The authorities manage the exchange rate as an intermediate target of monetary policy, with the objective of maintaining price stability as a sound basis for sustainable economic growth. The Singapore dollar is allowed to fluctuate within a targeted policy band and is managed against a basket of currencies of the countryʹs major trading partners. Currencies in the basket are assigned weights in accordance with the importance of the countries in Singaporeʹs trade relations with the world. The exchange rate policy is announced every six months in the Monetary Policy Statement, typically in terms of changes to the slope, central rate, and width of the policy band. In response to changing macroeconomic conditions, the policy parameters may also be adjusted outside the regular biannual cycle. The US dollar is the intervention currency. The Singapore dollar has been appreciating and, since February 2018, meets the criteria of a crawl-like arrangement. Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to crawl-like from stabilized, effective February 9, 2018. The MAS intervenes through agents and does not publish information on its interventions."
2018,936,Slovak Republic,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. The Slovak Republic participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies. The ECB publishes information regarding its interventions; it last intervened in March 2011. When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2018,961,Slovenia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Slovenia participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender.

When it intervenes, the ECB intervenes at the quotes of the market makers."
2018,813,Solomon Islands,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Solomon Islands dollar is pegged to an invoice-based basket of currencies consisting of the US dollar (with the weight of 58%), the Australian dollar (AUD) (32%), the New Zealand dollar (5%), the Japanese yen (3%), and the British pound (2%). The Central Bank of Solomon Islands (CBSI) sets the exchange rate vis-à-vis the US dollar in such a way as to maintain the value of the basket constant in Solomon Islands dollars given the movements of currencies in the basket relative to each other."
2018,726,Somalia,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is undetermined. Because of the absence of administrative measures controlling the level of the exchange rate, and the inoperative status of the CBS in the foreign exchange market, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a free floating arrangement. The rate is a freely determined, market clearing rate. The CBS publishes a daily, weighted average exchange rate measured in the various regional foreign exchange markets. Depending on local liquidity and demand conditions, exchanges rates can differ between regional foreign exchange markets."
2018,199,South Africa,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free-floating. The exchange rate of the rand is determined by market forces (that is, demand and supply) in the foreign exchange market. The SARB has a publicly announced foreign exchange policy of purchasing foreign currency in the local foreign exchange market when market conditions permit. The main objective for conducting spot purchases is to accumulate foreign exchange reserves. However, in certain exceptional cases, the SARBʹs involvement in the spot market is aimed at facilitating the smooth functioning of interbank foreign exchange market, for example, when there are relatively large foreign direct inflows into the country. In implementing its foreign exchange policy, the SARB does not seek to influence the level of the exchange rate. The SARB interacts with ADs as the price taker for official and commercial purposes. The market makers and brokers quote prices to other market participants; the SARB does not quote prices for market participants. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2018,733,South Sudan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The Bank of South Sudan (BSS) supplies foreign exchange to commercial banks in auctions, and an indicative market rate is determined from the auction rate and the rate charged by commercial banks. All government transactions are carried out using the indicative market rate. Since September 2017, the exchange rate followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the US dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified retroactively to crawl-like from other managed, effective September 6, 2017."
2018,184,Spain,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement of the euro area is free floating. Spain participates in a currency union (EMU) with 18 other members of the EU and has no separate legal tender. The euro, the common currency, floats freely and independently against other currencies.

2018,524,Sri Lanka,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating since its introduction by the Central Bank of Sri Lanka (CBSL) on January 23, 2001. The external value of the Sri Lanka rupee remained relatively stable, in 2017, under a more market-based exchange rate policy implemented by the CB during the year, limiting CB intervention in the foreign exchange market only to build up international reserves. The CBSL purchased foreign exchange from the market in early 2018 as part of the reserves building strategy. However, global market conditions tightened since April 2018, triggering balance of payments pressures. In 2018, the CBSL intervened in the market and sold US$1.1 billion on a net basis. In 2019, the CBSL resumed foreign exchange purchases to rebuild reserves, having bought US$134 million in net terms by end-April. The rupee depreciated to Rs 182.75 as of end-2018 (around 16% versus end-2017). While the rupee appreciated by around 4% to Rs 175.5 as of end-April 2019, more observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a crawl-like arrangement. The CBSL intervention data in the foreign exchange market is published on a monthly basis with a two-week lag."
2018,361,St. Kitts and Nevis,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Kitts and Nevis participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves. The operational guideline is set at 80%, although in practice the coverage has been about 100%."
2018,362,St. Lucia,972,III.C.2.,Currency board,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a currency board. St. Lucia participates in a currency union with seven other members of the ECCU and has no separate legal tender. The Eastern Caribbean dollar is pegged to the US dollar under a currency board arrangement at EC$2.70 per US dollar. The ECCB officially covers at least 60% of base money with its foreign reserves.

2018,732,Sudan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as managed floating. A managed float rate used by commercial banks is determined in the interbank market, in which participants deal directly with each other. The main objective of the policy is exchange rate stability. On October 7, 2018, the CBOS devalued the official exchange from SDG 18 per US dollar to SDG 47.5 per US dollar and removed the commercial bank incentive rate, allowing the commercial banks to set up a money market committee to determine the daily exchange rate. Because the Sudanese pound has stabilized within a 2% band against the US dollar since end-January 2018, with one realignment in October 2018, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to stabilized from other managed, effective January 22, 2018. The CBOS does not disclose information on its interventions to the public."
2018,366,Suriname,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. In accordance with a July 1994 presidential decree, the exchange rate is determined based on the demand and supply of foreign exchange. On February 6, 2016, the Central Bank of Suriname (Centrale Bank van Suriname, CBvS) announced that it would start conducting a weekly foreign exchange auction with commercial banks. On March 22, 2016, the authorities floated the currency based on a system of foreign exchange auctions aimed at ensuring a convergence of the official exchange rate to the market rate. On May 10, 2016, the CBvS authorized commercial banks and foreign exchange bureaus to freely determine exchange rates. Because the exchange rate has stabilized within a 2% band against the US dollar since February 2017, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2018,144,Sweden,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the krona is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are allowed under extraordinary circumstances (for example, participation in concerted interventions with other CBs). In January 2016, the Executive Board adopted a mandate that facilitates rapid intervention on the foreign exchange market for monetary policy purposes. The mandate was extended several times thereafter, but the Executive Board chose not to extend it further after the last extension, effective July 2, 2018, which expired February 12, 2019. No intervention has been reported since June 14, 2001."
2018,146,Switzerland,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate of the Swiss franc is determined by market forces in the foreign exchange market. However, the Swiss National Bank (SNB) reserves the right to intervene in the foreign exchange market. All settlements are made at free-market rates. In 2018, the SNB intervened with modest amounts in the foreign exchange market to counter an undesired tightening of monetary conditions. These interventions occurred mainly at times of heightened uncertainty, when the Swiss franc was particularly sought after as a safe investment. In H1 2018, the trade-weighted exchange rate remained broadly stable with temporary appreciation pressure amid equity market volatility and uncertainties surrounding the Italian election and budget. In H2 2018, the Swiss franc appreciated against the backdrop of political and macroeconomic uncertainties. This development continued in the first half of 2019. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating. The SNB publishes information regarding its foreign exchange transactions in its annual accountability report."
2018,463,Syria,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. Given the developments in the official rate, the emergence of the parallel market, and the intervention rate, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed arrangement."
2018,923,Tajikistan,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, with no predetermined path, but in practice the exchange rate is stabilized. Information about foreign currency purchase and sale operations by the NBT in the interbank market is provided to the IMF Resident Representative Office on a daily basis. In addition, information about the overall volume of foreign currency purchased and sold in the domestic exchange market (in the dollar equivalent) is published on a monthly basis in the NBTʹs statistical bulletin. Since July 2018, the exchange rate stabilized anew against the US dollar after having depreciated by around 6.8% from April 2018. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified twice (1) to other managed from stabilized, effective April 11, 2018, and (2) to stabilized from other managed, effective July 11, 2018."
2018,738,Tanzania,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. Exchange rate arrangement is floating. The BOT participates in the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM) for liquidity management purposes and intervenes occasionally to smooth out short-term volatility in the exchange rate. In carrying out these operations, the Bank remains mindful of the need to maintain adequate level of international reserves within the statutory requirement. Trading in the IFEM is conducted using the Reuters trading platform in a two-way quote system. The BOT is not required to indicate two-way quotes when it participates in the interbank market. In 2018, the shilling followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the US dollar. Accordingly, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to crawl-like from stabilized, effective January 1, 2018. The BOT does not publish information on foreign exchange interventions on the website."
2018,578,Thailand,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. Under the inflation-targeting monetary policy framework, the value of the baht is allowed to be determined by market forces, reflecting demand and supply in the foreign exchange market. In the case that the resulting movements in Thai baht (THB) are deemed excessive and unjustified by fundamentals, foreign exchange intervention can be undertaken to avoid disorderly market conditions. The data on interventions is not publicly available. However, the weekly and monthly data on gross international reserve is published on the CBʹs website, where international reserve assets comprise monetary gold, SDRs, reserve position in the fund, and foreign currency assets. During 2018, the real effective exchange rate (REER) appreciated, resulting in 2.7% real effective appreciation and 5% nominal appreciation versus the US dollar. The large current account surplus and sizable portfolio inflows were the main drivers, only partially offset by net outflows in FDI and other investment. In the recent period, the appreciation of the baht was particularly supported by flows from gold traders, which became increasingly active as gold price rose in response to heightened uncertainties in the global financial markets."
2018,313,The Bahamas,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg arrangement. The Bahamian dollar is pegged to the US dollar at par. Central Bank Act 2010 Article 9 establishes “that the Minister may, after consultation with the Bank, by order alter the said parity whether in terms of gold or any other standard.” The CB has fixed the Bahamian dollar parity to 1 US dollar since 1972."
2018,648,The Gambia,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The exchange rate is determined in the foreign exchange market. The Gambia participates in the W-ERM II of the WAMZ, which requires that the spot exchange rate between the dalasi and the US dollar be maintained within ±15% of the central rate; however, the authorities have not yet implemented these measures. The Central Bank of The Gambia (CBG) periodically intervenes in the foreign exchange market by selling and buying foreign exchange to augment international reserves and ensure market orderliness. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed. The CBG does not publish intervention data, but informs market makers on the results of each auction."
2018,537,Timor-Leste,971,III.C.1.,No separate legal tender,yes,The exchange rate arrangement is an exchange arrangement with no separate legal tender. The US dollar is legal tender and circulates freely.

2018,866,Tonga,976,III.C.7.,Pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands,yes,"The exchange rate arrangement is a pegged exchange rate within horizontal bands. The external value of the paʹanga is determined on the basis of a weighted currency basket comprising the US dollar, Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, and Fijian dollar. The basket weights are determined based on the proportions of trade with trading partners. The weights are not published. The exchange rate of the paʹanga in terms of the US dollar, the intervention currency, is fixed daily by the NRBT within a band of ±5% a month. The NRBT does not publish intervention data. Under Section 34 of the NRBT Act, the external value of the paʹanga is determined from time to time in a manner approved by the NRBT board, after consultation with the Ministry of Finance and National Planning, in view of Tongaʹs obligations connected with international monetary agreements in which it takes part. Section 35(1) of the NRBT Act empowers the NRBT to set the exchange rate."
2018,369,Trinidad and Tobago,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating. The CBTT intervenes regularly, and with no significant developments in the domestic foreign exchange market, the exchange rate has remained relatively stable. Because the Trinidad and Tobago dollar stabilized within a 2% band against the US dollar, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as stabilized. It publishes monthly purchases and sales by the CB and ADs, with a one-day lag."
2018,744,Tunisia,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is floating, as indicated on the Central Bank of Tunisia (BCT—Banque Centrale de Tunisie) website. The BCT intervenes in the foreign exchange market mostly to cover banksʹ short net open positions in foreign exchange. Effective August 1, 2018, the BCT introduced competitive foreign exchange auctions to support price discovery in the foreign exchange market but maintained bilateral transactions. The results of the auctions are published daily after each auction on the BCT contribution pages on Reuters. Effective January 1, 2019, the foreign exchange auctions became more frequent and the BCT ceased interventions outside the auction mechanism, and calls for tender (appel dʹoffre) became the sole intervention method. Previously, the BCT intervened in the foreign exchange market when market rates differed substantially from the dayʹs fixing rates, to smooth excessive fluctuations in the exchange rate for the dinar. While the exchange rate has stabilized within a 2% band against the euro since February 2019, more observations are necessary to determine its new trend. Until then, the de facto exchange rate arrangement remains classified as a crawl-like arrangement."
2018,186,Turkey,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. Under the current regime, the foreign exchange supply and demand is mainly determined by economic fundamentals, the monetary and fiscal policies implemented, international developments and expectations. The CBRT has no nominal or real exchange rate target. Nevertheless, if the exchange rates are at odds with economic fundamentals or excessive volatility poses risk to financial stability, the CBRT will not remain indifferent to these developments. If the exchange rate movements permanently affect price stability, the CBRT will change its monetary policy stance and give the necessary reaction. The CBRT will continue to closely monitor exchange rate developments and any risk factors related to it and will take necessary measures and use the relevant instruments to make sure that the foreign exchange market operates efficiently. The CBRT announced the general framework of the monetary and exchange rate policies envisaged for 2019 in a presentation titled “Monetary and Exchange Rate Policy for 2019” on December 5, 2018. The CBRT applies a reserve option mechanism (ROM) as a monetary policy tool. In this framework, the CBRT allows banks to hold a fraction of their mandatory reserves for lira liabilities in foreign currency and gold. The CBRT may increase or decrease the reserve option coefficients (ROCs), the amount of foreign currency or gold required to meet one unit of Turkish lira required reserves (RR). Typically, the ROC is an increasing function of different tranches of lira RR; the tranches of the mechanism and the corresponding levels of ROC are determined by the CBRT. The ROM has been used as an active policy tool by the CBRT and has contributed to stabilization of capital flow volatility, indirectly influencing exchange rate movement. In 2018, the CBRT contributed to banksʹ foreign exchange liquidity management through the instruments it used. The CBRT provided foreign exchange liquidity to the financial system via the reserve requirement ratios (RRRs) and ROM. Accordingly, the CBRT reduced foreign exchange and Turkish lira (TL) RRRs, and lowered the upper limit for the foreign exchange maintenance facility under the ROM, thereby providing approximately US$13.4 billion of liquidity to the financial system. The CBRT continued to conduct Foreign Exchange Deposits against Turkish lira deposits auctions, and with revisions made throughout the year, the auction amount was reduced to US$500 million from US$1.5 billion, the highest level in 2018. With a view to providing depth in foreign exchange markets and contributing to the corporate sectorʹs management of exchange rate risk, the CBRT continued to hold Turkish lira-settled forward foreign exchange sale auctions, which were launched in November 2017. In addition to these auctions, effective August 31, 2018, the TL-settled forward foreign exchange transactions were also launched at the Derivatives Market (VIOP) operating under BIST to contribute to the effective functioning of the foreign exchange markets. Total position amount of Turkish lira-settled forward foreign exchange transactions against TL at the CBRT and BIST VIOP has recently registered a decline. Effective November 1, 2018, TL currency swap market was opened at the CB to enhance banksʹ efficiency in TL and foreign exchange liquidity management. Moreover, CBRT, in line with its current monetary policy, conducts swap transactions in the BIST Swap Market. The CBRT continued with the efforts to bring out domestic gold savings into the financial system in this period as well. At the same time, transactions at the gold against foreign exchange market were launched, and banks were provided with the location swap facility in gold transactions. In 2018, the foreign exchange demand of US$7.2 billion of energy-importing state-owned enterprises was met by the CBRT. Given the CBRTʹs policy focus on limiting exchange rate volatility through the various instruments used, the de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as floating."
2018,925,Turkmenistan,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The Central Bank of Turkmenistan (CBT) is responsible for exchange rate policy implementation.

The authorities intervene in Ugandaʹs foreign exchange market when short-term fluctuations jeopardize its orderly operation. The Bank of Uganda (BOU) intervenes in the interbank foreign exchange market (IFEM) at the banksʹ quoted rates using the best bid-ask principle. The BOU publishes information on its interventions in its monthly, quarterly, and annual reports, including amounts purchased and sold through the reserve buildup program, interventions, and targeted transactions. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is floating."
2018,926,Ukraine,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The Monetary Policy Guidelines for 2018 and Medium Term (approved by the NBU Council September 21, 2017) call for the NBU to maintain a floating exchange rate arrangement, meaning that monetary policy will not be aimed at achieving a certain exchange rate target or range. At the same time, the NBU will use foreign currency interventions for the purpose of accumulating international reserves, smoothing out the functioning of the foreign exchange market, and maintaining the transmission of the key interest rate as the core monetary policy instrument. In the first half of 2018, the supply of foreign currency in the domestic currency market prevailed over the demand, which allowed the NBU to buy foreign currency to accumulate international reserves. In August, because of the deterioration of expectations, the demand for foreign currency increased. To level out the foreign exchange rate fluctuations, the NBU sold US dollars in the foreign exchange market. The purchase and sale of foreign currency by the NBU was not aimed at changing the trend of the exchange rate formed under the influence of market forces. The NBU publishes foreign exchange intervention data (weekly amounts purchased or sold, by type of intervention) on its website."
2018,466,United Arab Emirates,973,III.C.3.,Conventional peg,yes,The exchange rate arrangement is a conventional peg. The dirham was pegged to the US dollar in 1980. A January 2003 decision made the peg official. The United Arab Emirates Central Bank (UAECB) does not publish its intervention data.

The exchange rate of the pound sterling is determined on the basis of supply and demand in the foreign exchange market. The Bank of England (BOE) has a separate pool of foreign exchange reserves, which it uses at its discretion to intervene in support of its monetary policy objectives. A monthly press release issued by Her Majestyʹs Treasury (HMT) reports HMT and BOE intervention. There were no foreign exchange interventions during 2018."
2018,111,United States,979,III.C.10.,Free floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are free floating; the exchange rate of the US dollar is determined freely in the foreign exchange market. Foreign exchange interventions are not formally ruled out in the United States, but they are rarely used. The secretary of the Treasury is responsible for the formulation and implementation of international monetary and financial policy, including foreign exchange market intervention policy. The Federal Reserve (Fed) has separate legal authority to engage in foreign exchange operations, which are conducted in close and continuous consultation and cooperation with the Treasury to ensure consistency with US international monetary and financial policy. The Treasury and the Fed have closely coordinated their foreign exchange operations since early 1962, when the Fed commenced such operations at the request of the Treasury. Operations are conducted through the Federal Reserve Bank of New York, as fiscal agent of the United States and as the operating arm of the Federal Reserve System. Interventions are announced when they occur and the size of the interventions is reported in the Treasury and Federal Reserve Foreign Exchange Operations quarterly bulletin. US authorities last intervened in the foreign exchange market in March 2011, following the earthquake in Japan, in a coordinated G7 effort to sell Japanese yen. The United States did not intervene in the foreign exchange market during 2018."
2018,298,Uruguay,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are floating. The exchange rate of the peso is determined on the basis of supply and demand, although the CBU reserves the right to intervene to cushion abrupt changes in a concentrated market of few transactions. The intervention currency is the US dollar. The CB periodically intervenes in the exchange market to smooth excess exchange rate volatility without affecting fundamentals-driven trends. In 2018, the peso depreciated close to 12% against the US dollar. The exchange rate movement was impacted by the crisis in Argentina. The CBU publishes information on intervention on its website."
2018,927,Uzbekistan,975,III.C.6.,Crawl-like arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement of Uzbekistan is floating. The exchange rate is determined based on supply and demand for foreign currency on Uzbekistanʹs currency exchange. The CBU is a direct buyer of monetary gold produced in Uzbekistan, acting as supplier in the foreign exchange market in amounts equivalent to the volume of gold purchased from producers. The CBU also intervenes in the foreign exchange market to smooth out undue short-term volatility. Foreign exchange sales by the CBU in the foreign exchange market are not directed at affecting fundamental trend of the exchange rate and are driven exclusively by the aim of sterilizing additional liquidity from the CBU purchases of monetary gold. The sum–US dollar exchange rate is used as an operational benchmark, because the vast majority of the countryʹs trading operations are carried out in US dollars. From May 2018, the exchange rate increased its volatility and departed from the stabilized arrangement but followed a depreciating trend within a 2% band against the US dollar since mid-July 2018 (with one realignment in September 2018). Therefore, the de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified twice: (1) to other managed from stabilized, effective May 8, 2018, and (2) to craw-like from other managed, effective July 19, 2018. Data on the CBU interventions are published on the CBU website in quarterly “Survey of the Domestic Exchange Market” publications."
2018,846,Vanuatu,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"Since 1988, Vanuatu has officially maintained an adjustable peg exchange rate arrangement. Currently, the exchange rate of the vatu is linked to a transaction-weighted (trade and tourism receipts) basket of currencies whose weights and composition are not publicly disclosed and are adjusted periodically. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed, because the composite weights are not disclosed and cannot be confirmed, and, in practice, the vatu has been more volatile against a composite than the 2% band typical of stabilized or pegged arrangements."
2018,299,Venezuela,977,III.C.8.,Other managed arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate is a conventional peg against the US dollar. Effective February 14, 2018, the DICOM is the single official exchange rate in Venezuela. The DICOM rate is determined through an auction system. Article 28 of the Exchange Agreement No. 39 indicates that the exchange rate to be used by public and private sectors for all settlement operations in foreign currency will be the DICOM exchange rate. The DICOM rate stood at BsF/US$5,189.56 (buying) and BsF/US$5202.57 (selling) on May 13, 2019. In addition to the official DICOM exchange rate, there is a parallel market that is widely used by the private sector and individuals. As of May 13, 2019, the parallel EXR stood at 5698.53 bolivars per dollar, according to DolarToday. Previously, the following exchange rate existed. Since March 10, 2016, a fixed exchange rate called the Protected Exchange Rate (DIPRO) (Exchange Rate Agreement No. 35 published in the Official Gazette G.O. No. 40,865 on March 9, 2016) was set at Bs 10.000/US$ (selling) and Bs 9.975/US$ (buying). After the entry into force of Exchange Arrangement (EA) No. 35, the DIPRO rate of exchange was applied to the acquisition of foreign currency for the importation of the goods determined by the Ministries of Industry and Commerce and of Banking and Finance—with the previous opinion of the Vice-presidency of the Republic and the Venezuelan Central Bank (in English: VCB or in Spanish: BCV—Banco Central de Venezuela) in lists of products and tariff codes of the food and health sectors and raw materials and consumable supplies associated with the production of the same. The DIPRO rate of exchange was applied to the foreign currency intended for conversion of pensions for old age, retirement, partial disability, incapacity, and survivors paid by the Venezuelan Institute of Social Security (Instituto Venezolano de los Seguros Sociales—IVSS) to persons residing abroad. Also, the DIPRO rate of exchange was applied to the foreign currency intended for expenses for recovery of health, sports, culture, scientific research, and other cases of special urgency defined in the exchange rules. The DIPRO rate was used for the payment of foreign public debt, and for the settlement of imports of goods published in the list of customs tariff codes, channeled through the Reciprocal Payments and Credits Agreements entered into with the CBs of the LAIA (in Spanish: ALADI) member countries, the Central Bank of the Dominican Republic, as well as the operating banks authorized to process transactions through the Unitary System of Regional Payment Compensation (SUCRE). Variable exchange rates: There were additional four official exchange rates, namely: (1) The rate produced by the Complementary Foreign Exchange Administration System (Sistema complementario de administracion de divisas—SICAD) in special auctions or from securities denominated in foreign currencies issued through the system, which stood at Bs/US$13.15 at end-2015—no auctions were held in 2016 (Exchange Agreement (EA) No. 26 of April 3, 2014, published in G.O. No. 40,391 of April 10, 2014). (2) The rate derived from the Alternative Foreign Exchange System (SICAD II), which corresponds to the weighted average of purchase and sales operations in foreign currency or securities denominated in foreign currencies, conducted on a daily basis through this system. However, it should be noted that SICAD II operations were suspended February 12, 2015, therefore the applicable exchange rate is the rate from the systemʹs last trading session published on the website of the BCV, which is Bs/US$51.9710 (buying) and Bs/US$52.1013 (selling). (3) The weighted average of purchase and sales operations in foreign currency or securities denominated in foreign currencies, conducted on a daily basis in highly liquid markets and in securities regulated under Exchange Agreement No. 33 of February 10, 2015, which stood at Bs/US$672.0772 (buying) and Bs/US$673.7617 (selling) at end-2016. Article 31 of the Exchange Agreement No. 39 establishes that the conversion of foreign currency for the determination of the taxable amount of tax obligations derived from customs operations will be carried out at the DICOM exchange rate in effect on the date of the operation. Article 33 indicates that the exchange rate to be used for foreign currency conversion for the determination of the amounts to be paid because of the customs and tax penalties regimes will be the DICOM exchange rate at the date of the corresponding sanction. The tax obligations established in special laws, as well as the rates, commissions, surcharges, and public prices that have been set in the corresponding regulations in foreign currency, may be paid alternatively in the currency in which they are denominated, in their equivalent in other foreign currency in accordance with the price published for that purpose by the Central Bank of Venezuela (BCV), or in bolivars applying the DICOM in force at the date of the transaction. (Exchange Agreement No. 39, Article 34). Effective May 2, 2019, individuals and private companies can buy and sell foreign currency through local commercial banks and exchange houses with no constraints on prices or amounts. The new market has been established where private foreign exchange buyers and sellers interacted under BCVʹs control. Individuals are still transacting small amounts in euros in cash in DICOM with government-owned banks. The BCV continues publishing the DICOM rate daily. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as other managed."
2018,582,Vietnam,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"Clause 2, Article 15 Decree No. 70/2014/ND-CP of July 17, 2014, clarifies the following: (1) The official exchange rate is determined based on demand and supply in the foreign exchange market under State Bank of Vietnam (SBV) regulations. The SBV regulates the exchange rate by deploying monetary policy instruments and intervening in the foreign exchange market. (2) The de jure exchange rate arrangement is managed floating, and is determined by the SBV based on a currency basket of countries with trade, financing, and investment relationships with Vietnam, consistent with macroeconomic targets of each period. Decision No. 2730/QD-NHNN specifies that the central exchange rate is announced daily, based on reference of the interbank-weighted exchange rate, exchange rate developments in global markets of some currencies that are of Vietnamʹs major investment, credit, and trading partners, monetary and macroeconomic balances, and monetary policy targets. The dong–US dollar exchange rate might fluctuate around the average interbank foreign currency market exchange rate announced by the SBV within a daily transaction band of ±3%. In 2018, the dong remained stabilized within a 2% band against the US dollar, with a realignment in July 2018. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2018,474,Yemen,974,III.C.4.,Stabilized arrangement,yes,"The de jure exchange rate arrangement is free floating. The Central Bank of Yemen (CBY) receives most of the foreign exchange proceeds, particularly crude oil export revenues, official loans, and official development assistance. After an adjustment of 16.4% in April 2016, the official exchange rate has remained steady at about Yrls 250. The de facto exchange rate arrangement is classified as a stabilized arrangement."
2018,754,Zambia,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"The de jure and de facto exchange rate arrangements are classified as floating. The official exchange rate is determined in the interbank market. The BOZ intervenes primarily through transactions with ADs, which are registered commercial banks that meet the prescribed eligibility criteria under the Interbank Foreign Exchange Market Framework. The BOZ interventions are published as historical data, and its foreign exchange transactions are published in the biweekly statistics. In September 2018, there was a 20% depreciation of the Kwacha against the US dollar due a weakening of economic fundamentals coupled with broader exchange market pressures and a downgrade by all major international rating agencies. Since then, there have been periods of relative stability and periods of depreciation of the currency. With the increased demand for US dollars as the debt service burden increases as well as lower export earnings from copper along with higher imports, reserves have declined. The exchange rate has reached 12.88 as of early-May 2019. Daily data on intervention is published on a biweekly basis with a 3-month lag. The data is published with a 3- month lag."
2018,698,Zimbabwe,978,III.C.9.,Floating,yes,"Effective February 20, 2019, Zimbabwe adopted a de jure floating exchange rate arrangement, previously a “no separate legal tender” arrangement. The RBZ denominated legally, through SI No. 33 of 2019, the existing RTGS balances, bond notes, and coins in circulation as RTGS dollars making them part of the multi-currency system in Zimbabwe. An interbank foreign exchange market was established to formalize the trading of RTGS dollar balances and bond notes with the US dollars and other currencies on a willing seller-willing buyer basis through banks and bureau de changes. This decision to establish a flexible exchange rate market was taken in consultation with Government and business taking into consideration the distortions in the market caused by multi-pricing. The de facto exchange rate arrangement was reclassified to floating from other managed, effective February 20, 2019. Effective June 24, 2019, the currency of Zimbabwe is the Zimbabwe dollar and is the sole legal tender, replacing at par with the previous RTGS dollar, and the multi-currency system in place since 2009 was discontinued."
