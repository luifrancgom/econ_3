- This presentation is based on [@blanchard_macroeconomics_2017, Chapter 3]

# Purpose

Examine the equilibrium of the goods market and the determination of production.

# The macroeconomic identity

- GDP refers to the final products that are produced within a territory. However, a key element to include are imports to examine the commercial relations with the rest of the world. 

- GDP can be expressed as: $GDP_s^f(t)= C_s^f(t) + G_s^f(t) + I_s^f(t) + X_s^f(t)$

    + Where $s$ refers to a certain territory, $t$ a period of time and $f$ are the monetary units in which the nominal GDP is measured. Also:

        + $GDP_s^f(t)$ is the final production of products produced **within** $s$.
        + $C_s^f(t)$ is the final consumption expenditure by households and the NPISHs[^1] of products produced **within** $s$.
        + $G_s^f(t)$ is the final consumption expenditure by the government of products produced **within** $s$.
        + $I_s^f(t)$ is the investment[^2] made with products produced **within** $s$.
        + $X_s^f(t)$ is the use of products by economic units **outside** $s$ but produced **within** $s$, that is, exports.

[^1]: Non-profit institutions serving households
[^2]: Known as **gross capital formation** in the lingo of national accounts system

# Imports

- It is important to keep in mind that imports refer to final products produced **outside** the territory $s$ but used **within** the territory $s$. Imports can be used to consume or invest. In that sense: $IM_s^f(t)= C_{rw}^f(t) + I_{rw}^f(t) + G_{rw}^f(t)$

    + Where:
        + $IM_s^f(t)$ are the imports of the territory $s$.
        + $C_{rw}^f(t)$ is the final consumption expenditure by households and the NPISHs of the territory $s$ of products produced in the rest of the world, $rw$.
        + $I_{rw}^f(t)$ is the investment made with products produced in the rest of the world, $rw$.
        + $G_{rw}^f(t)$ is the final consumption expenditure by the government of products produced in the rest of the world, $rw$.
        
# Imports

- To include imports, we can add and subtract them as follows: $GDP_s^f(t)= [C_s^f(t) + C_{rw}^f(t)] + [G_s^f(t) + G_{rw}^f(t)] + [I_s^f(t) + I_{rw}^f(t)] + X_s^f(t) - IM_s^f(t)$

- In that way we can group the following variables:

    + $C^f(t) \equiv C_s^f(t) + C_{rw}^f(t)$ is the total final consumption expenditure by households and the NPISHs in $s$. 
    + $I^f(t) \equiv I_s^f(t) + I_{rw}^f(t)$ is the total investment in $s$.
    + $G^f(t) \equiv G_s^f(t) + G_{rw}^f(t)$ is the total final consumption expenditure by the government in $s$.

- In that way $GDP_s^f(t) \equiv C_s^f(t) + I_s^f(t) + G_s^f(t) + X_s^f(t) - IM_s^f(t)$

- If the subscripts and superscripts are removed to facilitate the notation, we have the expression that are usually found in the economics textbooks: $GDP(t) \equiv C(t) + I(t) + G(t) + X(t) - IM(t)$ 

# Imports

- What happens if a car is imported and a household acquires it within the territory?

    + The value of the car is subtracted from $IM(t)$ but it is added to $C(t)$.

- What happens if a machine is imported and a company acquires it within the territory to produce other products?

    + The value of the machine is subtracted from IM(t) but added to the I(t).

- What happens if a product is imported and the government acquires it to provide a service to citizens within the territory?

    + The value of the product is subtracted from IM(t) but added to G(t).

# Domestic production plus imports and aggregate demand

$$\begin{split}
   GDP(t) & \equiv C(t) + I(t) + G(t) + X(t) - IM(t) \\
   \underbrace{GDP(t)}_\text{Domestic production} + \underbrace{IM(t)}_\text{Imports} & \equiv \underbrace{C(t) + I(t) + G(t)}_\text{Domestic aggregate demand} + \underbrace{X(t)}_\text{Exports} \\
   \underbrace{GDP(t) + IM(t)}_\text{Aggregate supply} & \equiv \underbrace{C(t) + I(t) + G(t) + X(t)}_\text{Aggregate demand}
   \end{split}$$

# Types of equations in the models

- **Identities**: are relationships that are true by definition.

    + Accounting equation: $Assets \equiv Liabilities + Equity$
    
    + Accounting of GDP as the value of final products: $GDP(t) \equiv C(t) + I(t) + G(t) + X(t) - IM(t)$
    
    + Definition of tangent function in trigonometry: $tan\;\theta \equiv \frac{sin\;\theta}{cos\;\theta}$
    
# Types of equations in the models

- **Behavioral equations**: represent hypotheses about how a variable is determined.

    + How does consumption behave? In economics, an **ideal** consumption function is assumed that explains how this variable is determined: $C(t) = c_0 + c_1Y_D(t)\;c_0 > 0\;0 < c_1 < 1$ 

    + What is the maximum distance a projectile travels from the ground? In physics, an **ideal** projectile motion function is assumed that explains how this variable is determined: $X_{ideal}^{max} = \frac{v_0^2sin(2\theta)}{g}$ [@mattos_movimiento_2014]

include_graphics(path = '004_projectile_motion.png')
```

# Types of equations in the models

- **Equilibrium conditions**: establish a requirement that should be met.

    + What condition must be met in a market so that resources are optimally allocated? The quantity demanded should tend to be equal to the quantity supplied **or there will be a surplus or shortage**.

    + What condition must be met in a supermarket when people line up with their cart to pay? The length of the rows should tend to be the same **or people will change lines**.
    
        + **Disequilibrium** (left) and **equilibrium** (right) situations:

# Goods market model

- The models that will be seen can be expressed in three ways: algebraically, graphically and explained with words.

- **Algebraically**

    + Aggregate demand (identity) assuming no commercial relations with the rest of the world and that investment doesn't vary: $Z(t) \equiv C(t) + \overline{I} + G(t)$.
    
    + Aggregate supply as the added value of production: $Y(t)$.
    
    + Consumption (behavioral equation): $C(t) = c_0 + c_1Y_D(t)$.
    
    + Disposabel income (identity): $Y_D(t) \equiv Y_R(t) - T(t)$.
    
        + Where $T(t)$ includes taxes paid minus transfers from the state that consumers receive.
        
        + By definition aggregate value is equivalent to the sum of the different incomes in a territory (identity) $Y(t) \equiv Y_R(t)$. Therefore $Y_D(t) = Y(t) - T(t)$. 
        
# Goods market model

- **Algebraically**

    + Equilibrium condition:

$$\begin{split}
   Y(t) & = Z(t) \\
   Y(t) & = C(t) + \overline{I} + G(t) \\
   Y(t) & = c_0 + c_1Y_D(t) + \overline{I} + G(t) \\
   Y(t) & = c_0 + c_1(Y(t) - T(t)) + \overline{I} + G(t) \\
   Y^*(t) & = \frac{1}{1 - c_1}(c_0 + \overline{I} + G(t) - c_1T(t)
   \end{split}$$

# Goods market model

- Using **words**

    + **Equilibrium condition**:
    
        + If $Y(t) > Z(t)$ then companies accumulate inventories by not selling everything they produce. Therefore they restrict production until they sell their inventories.
        
        + If $Y(t) < Z(t)$ households or NPISHs seek to consume more, companies want to invest more and government want to spend more. However, production is not enough, so a shortage is generated and the prices of final products rise. As prices rise there are incentives to produce more.
        
    + **Consumption function**: $C(t) = c_0 + c_1(Y(t) - T(t))$
    
         + If $c_0 > 0$ it means that if the disposable income is equal to zero, consumers can: dissave selling for example assets or using money accumulated in previous periods or borrowing.
         
         + If $0 < c_1 < 1$ it means that if the disposable income increases, consumers do not consume or save the entire increase.
         
# Goods market model

- Using **words**

    + **Equilibrium production**: $Y^*(t) = \frac{1}{1 - c_1}(c_0 + \overline{I} + G(t) - c_1T(t))$
    
        + If public spending increases, $G(t)$, the equilibrium production, $Y^*(t)$, increases more than the increase in spending but only in $t$.
          
        + Public spending cannot increase indefinitely and if it does then in later periods taxes will raise. That is to say, $T(t)$ will have to increase.
          
        + This effect occurs because $\frac{1}{1 - c_1} > 1$. Therefore, the government can boost the economy but only in $t$ and not indefinitely. How much? It will depend on $c_1$.
        
        + Let's assume that $c_1 = 0.6$, that is, for every 100 monetary units that disposable income increases, consumption increases by 60 monetary units. Therefore $\frac{1}{1 - c_1} = 1.5$, so for every 100 monetary units that public spending increases equilibrium production increases 150 monetary units. It is an excellent situation but only in $t$ since this cannot be done indefinitely.

# Taxes in Colombia

- In the model taxes are part but not equal to $T(t)$ because $T(t)$ includes taxes paid minus transfers from the state that consumers receive.

- In economics, taxes are understood as compulsory payments made by individuals to finance the activities that the government has decided to carry out, regardless of whether the compulsory payment has a specific destination or whether or not it is proportional to the goods or services received. [@observatorio_fiscal_pontificia_universidad_javeriana_guiciudadana_2018, p 5].

- In Colombian tax law, taxes are divides in 3 categories: "impuestos", "tasas" and "contribuciones". In economics we don't make this distinction where we refer simply to the concept of tax (tributo in spanish).
